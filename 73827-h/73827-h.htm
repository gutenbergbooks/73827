<h2>PREFACE </h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">A book</span> is a machine to think with, but it need not, therefore, 
usurp the functions either of the bellows or the locomotive. 
This book might better be compared to a loom on which it is proposed 
to re-weave some ravelled parts of our civilisation. What is 
most important about it, the interconnection of its several points 
of view, might have been exhibited, though not with equal clarity, 
in a pamphlet or in a two-volume work. Few of the separate items 
are original. One does not expect novel cards when playing so 
traditional a game; it is the hand which matters. I have chosen 
to present it here on the smallest scale which would allow me 
to fit together the various positions adopted into a whole of 
some firmness. The elaborations and expansions which suggest 
themselves have been constantly cut short at the point at which 
I thought that the reader would be able to see for himself how 
they would continue. The danger of this procedure, which otherwise 
has great advantages both for him and for me, is that the different 
parts of a connected account such as this mutually illumine one 
another. The writer, who has, or should have, the whole position 
in his mind throughout, may overlook sources of obscurity for 
the reader, due to the serial form of the exposition. This I 
have endeavoured to prevent by means of numerous cross-references, 
forwards and backwards. </p>

<p>But some further explanation of the structure of the book is 
due to the reader. At sundry points—notably in Chapters VI, 
VII, and XI-XV—its progress appears to be interrupted by lengthy 
excursions into theory of value, or into general psychology. 
These I would have omitted if it had seemed in any way possible 
to develop the argument of the rest strongly and clearly in their 
absence. Criticism, as I understand it, is the endeavour to discriminate 
between experiences and to evaluate them. We cannot do this without 
some understanding of the nature of experience, or without theories 
of valuation and communication. Such principles as apply in criticism 
must be taken from these more fundamental studies. All other 
critical principles are arbitrary, and the history of the subject 
is a record of their obstructive influence. The view of value 
implied throughout is one which must be held in some form by 
very many persons. Yet I have been unable to discover anywhere 
any statement of it to which I might satisfactorily refer the 
reader. I had to make a fairly full statement with applications 
and illustrations myself. And I had to put in the forefront of 
the book where, to the more exclusively literary reader, it will 
appear a dry and uninviting tract to be crossed for problematical 
advantages. The same remarks apply to the second theoretical 
expansion, the psychological chapters; they are to the value 
chapters, I fear, as a Sahara to a Gobi. No other choice seemed 
open if I did not wish my later, critical, sections to be misunderstood, 
than to include as a preliminary what amounts to a concise treatise 
on psychology. For nearly all the topics of psychology are raised 
at one point or another by criticism, but raised from an angle 
which ordinary text-books do not contemplate. These two deserts 
passed, the rest of the book accords, I believe, much more closely 
with what may be expected of an essay in criticism, although 
the language in which some of the more obvious remarks are couched 
may seem unnecessarily repellant. The explanation of much of 
the turgid uncouthness of its terminology is the desire to link 
even the commonplaces of criticism to a systematic exposition 
of psychology. The reader who appreciates the advantages so gained 
will be forgiving. </p>

<p>I have carefully remembered throughout that I am not writing 
for specialists alone. The omissions, particularly as to qualifications 
and reservations, which this fact entails, should in fairness 
to myself be mentioned. </p>

<p>My book, I fear, will seem to many sadly lacking in the condiments 
which have come to be expected in writings upon literature. Critics 
and even theorists in criticism currently assume that their first 
duty is to be moving, to excite in the mind emotions appropriate 
to their august subject-matter. This endeavour I have declined. 
I have used, I believe, few words which I could not define in 
the actual use which I have made of them, and necessarily such 
words have little or no emotive power. I have comforted myself 
with the reflection that there is perhaps something debilitated 
about a taste for speculation which requires a flavouring of 
the eternal and the ultimate or even of the literary spices, 
mystery and profundity. Mixed modes of writing which enlist the 
reader’s feeling as well as his thinking are becoming dangerous 
to the modern consciousness with its increasing awareness of 
the distinction. Thought and feeling are able to mislead one 
another at present in ways which were hardly possible six centuries 
ago. We need a spell of purer science and purer poetry before 
the two can again be mixed, if indeed this will ever become once 
more desirable. In the Second Edition I added a note on Mr. Eliot’s 
poetry which will elucidate what I mean here by purity, and some 
supplementary remarks upon Value; in the Third, a few minor improvements 
have been made. </p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that the knowledge which the men of 
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 3000 will possess, if all goes well, may make all our æsthetics, 
all our psychology, all our modern theory of value, look pitiful. 
Poor indeed would be the prospect if this were not so. The thought, 
“What shall we do with the powers, which we are so rapidly developing, 
and what will happen to us if we cannot learn to guide them in 
time?” already marks for many people the chief interest of existence. 
The controversies which the world has known in the past are as 
nothing to those which are ahead. I would wish this book to be 
regarded as a contribution towards these choices of the future. </p>

<p>Between the possession of ideas and their application there is 
a gulf. Every teacher winces when he remembers this. As an attempt 
to attack this difficulty, I am preparing a companion volume, 
<i>Practical Criticism</i>. Extremely good and extremely bad 
poems were put <i>unsigned</i> before a large and able audience. 
The comments they wrote at leisure give, as it were, a stereoscopic 
view of the poem and of possible opinion on it. This material 
when systematically analysed, provides, not only an interesting 
commentary upon the state of contemporary culture, but a new 
and powerful educational instrument. </p>

<span class="smcap">The Chaos of Critical Theories</span></h2>
<div class ="epigraph" style="text-align: center; text-indent:0em">
O monstrous! but one half-pennyworth of bread to this intolerable <br>
deal of sack!—<i>The First Part of King Henry the Fourth.</i>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> literature of Criticism is not small or negligible, and its 
chief figures, from Aristotle onwards, have often been among 
the first intellects of their age. Yet the modern student, surveying 
the field and noting the simplicity of the task attempted and 
the fragments of work achieved, may reasonably wonder what has 
been and is amiss. For the experiences with which criticism is 
concerned are exceptionally accessible, we have only to open 
the book, stand before the picture, have the music played, spread 
out the rug, pour out the wine, and the material upon which the 
critic works is presently before us. Even too abundantly, in 
too great fullness perhaps: “More warmth than Adam needs” the 
critic may complain, echoing Milton’s complaint against the climate 
of the Garden of Eden; but he is fortunate not to be starved 
of matter like the investigator of psychoplasm. And the questions 
which the critic seeks to answer, intricate though they are, 
do not seem to be extraordinarily difficult. What gives the experience 
of reading a certain poem its value? How is this experience better 
than another? Why prefer this picture to that? In which ways 
should we listen to music so as to receive the most valuable 
moments? Why is one opinion about works of art not as good as 
another? These are the fundamental questions which criticism 
is required to answer, together with such preliminary questions—What 
<i>is</i> a picture, a poem, a piece of music? How can experiences 
be compared? What is value?—as may be required in order to approach 
these questions. </p>

<p>But if we now turn to consider what are the results yielded by 
the best minds pondering these questions in the light of the 
eminently accessible experiences provided by the Arts, we discover 
an almost empty garner. A few conjectures, a supply of admonitions, 
many acute isolated observations, some brilliant guesses, much 
oratory and applied poetry, inexhaustible confusion, a sufficiency 
of dogma, no small stock of prejudices, whimsies and crotchets, 
a profusion of mysticism, a little genuine speculation, sundry 
stray inspirations, pregnant hints and random <i>aperçus</i>; 
of such as these, it may be said without exaggeration, is extant 
critical theory composed. </p>

<p>A few specimens of the most famous utterances of Aristotle, Longinus, 
Horace, Boileau, Dryden, Addison, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Carlyle, 
Matthew Arnold, and some more modern authors, will justify this 
assertion. “All men naturally receive pleasure from imitation.” 
“Poetry is chiefly conversant about general truth.” “It demands 
an enthusiasm allied to madness; transported out of ourselves 
we become what we imagine.” “Beautiful words are the very and 
peculiar light of the mind.” “Let the work be what you like, 
provided it has simplicity and unity.” “De Gustibus. . .” “Of 
writing well right thinking is the beginning and the fount.” 
“We must never separate ourselves from Nature.” “Delight is the 
chief, if not the only end; instruction can be admitted but in 
the second place.” “The pleasures of Fancy are more conducive 
to health than those of the understanding.” “The spontaneous 
overflow of powerful feeling.” “The best words in the best order.” 
“The whole soul of man in activity.” “Unity in variety.” “The 
synthetic and magical power of the imagination.” “The eye on 
the object.” “The disimprisonment of the soul of fact.” “The 
identification of content and form.” “A criticism of Life.” “Empathy 
favourable to our existence.” “Significant form.” “The expression 
of impressions,” etc. etc. </p>

<p>Such are the pinnacles, the <i>apices</i> of critical theory, 
the heights gained in the past by the best thinkers in their 
attempt to reach explanations of the value of the arts. Some 
of them, many of them indeed, are profitable starting-points 
for reflection, but neither together, nor singly, nor in any 
combination do they give what is required. Above them and below 
them, around and about them can be found other things of value, 
of service for the appreciation of particular poems and works 
of art; comment, elucidation, appraisal, much that is fit occupation 
for the contemplative mind. But apart from hints such as have 
been cited, no explanations. The central question, What is the 
value of the arts, why are they worth the devotion of the keenest 
hours of the best minds, and what is their place in the system 
of human endeavours? is left almost untouched, although without 
some clear view it would seem that even the most judicious critic 
must often lose his sense of position. </p>

<br>

<p>But perhaps the literature of Criticism is the wrong place in 
which to expect such an inquiry. Philosophers, Moralists and 
Æstheticians are perhaps the competent authorities? There is 
certainly no lack of treatises upon the Good and the Beautiful, 
upon Value and upon the Æsthetic State, and the treasures of 
earnest endeavour lavished upon these topics have not been in 
vain. Those investigators who have relied upon Reason, upon the 
Select Intuition and the Ineluctable Argument, who have sat down 
without the necessary facts to think the matter out, have at 
least thoroughly discredited a method which apart from their 
labours would hardly have been suspected of the barrenness it 
has shown. And those who, following Fechner, have turned instead 
to the collection and analysis of concrete, particular facts 
and to empirical research into æsthetics have supplied a host 
of details to psychology. In recent years especially, much useful 
information upon the processes which make up the appreciation 
of works of art has been skilfully elicited. But it is showing 
no ingratitude to these investigators if we point out certain 
defects of almost all experimental work on æsthetics, which make 
their results at best of only indirect service to our wider problems. </p>

<p>The most obvious of these concerns their inevitable choice of 
experiments. Only the simplest human activities are at present 
amenable to laboratory methods. Æstheticians have therefore been 
compelled to begin with as simple forms of ‘æsthetic choice’ 
as can be devised. In practice, line-lengths and elementary forms, 
single notes and phrases, single colours and simple collocations, 
nonsense syllables, metronomic beats, skeleton rhythms and metres 
and similar simplifications have alone been open to investigation. 
Such more complex objects as have been examined have yielded 
very uncertain results, for reasons which anyone who has ever 
<i>both</i> looked at a picture or read a poem <i>and</i> been inside a psychological 
laboratory or conversed with a representative psychologist will 
understand. </p>

<p>The generalisations to be drawn from these simple experiments 
are, if we do not expect too much, encouraging. Some light upon 
obscure processes, such as empathy, and upon the intervention 
of muscular imagery and tendencies to action into the apprehension 
of shapes and of sequences of sounds which had been supposed 
to be apprehended by visual or auditory apparatus alone, some 
interesting facts about the plasticity of rhythm, some approach 
towards a classification of the different ways in which colours 
may be regarded, increased recognition of the complexity of even 
the simplest activities, these and similar results have been 
well worth the trouble expended. But more important has been 
the revelation of the great variety in the responses which even 
the simplest stimuli elicit. Even so unambiguous an object as 
a plain colour, it has been found, can arouse in different persons 
and in the same person at different times extremely different 
states of mind. From this result it may seem no illegitimate 
step to conclude that highly complex objects, such as pictures, 
will arouse a still greater variety of responses, a conclusion 
very awkward for any theory of criticism, since it would appear 
to decide adversely the preliminary question: “How may experiences 
be compared?” which any such theory must settle if the more fundamental 
questions of value are to be satisfactorily approached. </p>

<p>But just here a crucial point arises. There seems to be good 
reason to suppose that the more simple the object contemplated 
the more varied the responses will be which can be expected from 
it. For it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to contemplate a 
comparatively simple object by itself. Inevitably it is taken 
by the contemplator into some context, and made part of some 
larger whole, and under such experimental conditions as have 
yet been devised it seems not possible to guarantee the kind 
of context into which it is taken. A comparison with the case 
of words is instructive. A single word by itself, let us say 
‘night,’ will raise almost as many different thoughts and feelings 
as there are persons who hear it. The range of variety with a 
single word is very little restricted. But put it into a sentence 
and the variation is narrowed; put it into the context of a whole 
passage, and it is still further fixed; and let it occur in such 
an intricate whole as a poem and the responses of competent readers 
may have a similarity which only its occurrence in such a whole 
can secure. The point will arise for discussion when the problem 
of corroboration for critical judgments is dealt with later (cf. 
pp. 166, 178, 192). It had to be mentioned here in order to explain 
why the theory of criticism shows no great dependence upon experimental 
æsthetics, useful in many respects as these investigations are. </p>

<span class="smcap">The Phantom Æsthetic State</span> </h2>
<div class ="epigraph">
<p style="text-align: center; text-indent:0em">None of his follies will he repent, none will he wish to repeat; no <br>
happier lot can be assigned to man.—<i>Wilhelm Mester</i>. </p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">A more</span> serious defect in æsthetics is the avoidance of considerations 
as to value. It is true that an ill-judged introduction of value 
considerations usually leads to disaster, as in Tolstoy’s case. 
But the fact that some of the experiences to which the arts give 
rise are valuable and take the form they do because of their 
value is not irrelevant. Whether this fact is of service in analysis 
will naturally depend upon the theory of value adopted. But to 
leave it out of account altogether is to run the risk of missing 
the clue to the whole matter. And the clue has in fact been missed. </p>

<p>All modern æsthetics rests upon an assumption which has been 
strangely little discussed, the assumption that there is a distinct 
<i>kind</i> of mental activity present in what are called æsthetic 
experiences. Ever since “the first rational word concerning beauty”<a id="note2.1text"></a><a href="#note2.1">†</a> 
was spoken by Kant, the attempt to define the ‘judgment of taste’ 
as concerning pleasure which is disinterested, universal, unintellectual, 
and not to be confused with the pleasures of sense or of ordinary 
emotions, in short to make it a thing <i>sui generis</i>, has 
continued. Thus arises the phantom problem of the æsthetic mode 
or æsthetic state, a legacy from the days of abstract investigation 
into the Good, the Beautiful and the True. </p>

<p>The temptation to align this tripartite division with a similar 
division into Will, Feeling and Thought was irresistible. “All 
the faculties of the Soul, or capacities, are reducible to three, 
which do not admit of any further derivation from a common ground: 
the <i>faculty of knowledge</i>, the <i>feeling of pleasure or 
displeasure</i>, and the <i>faculty of desire</i>”<a id="note2.2text"></a><a href="#note2.2">†</a> said Kant. 
Legislative for each of these faculties stood Understanding, 
Judgment and Reason respectively. “Between the faculties of knowledge 
and desire stands the feeling of pleasure, just as judgment is 
intermediate between understanding and reason.” And he went on 
to discuss æsthetics as appertaining to the province of judgment, 
the middle one of these three, the first and last having already 
occupied him in his two other Critiques of Pure and Practical 
Reason respectively. The effect was virtually to annex æsthetics 
to Idealism, in which fabric it has ever since continued to serve 
important purposes. </p>

<p>This accident of formal correspondence has had an influence upon 
speculation which would be ridiculous if it had not been so disastrous. 
It is difficult even now to get out of ruts which have been seen 
to lead nowhere. With the identification of the provinces of 
Truth and Thought no quarrel arises, and the Will and the Good 
are, as we shall see, intimately connected, but the attempts 
to fit Beauty into a neat pigeon-hole with Feeling have led to 
calamitous distortions. It is now generally abandoned,<a id="note2.3text"></a><a href="#note2.3">*</a> although 
echoes of it can be heard everywhere in critical writings. The 
peculiar use of ‘emotion’ by reviewers, and the prevalence of 
the phrase ‘æsthetic emotion’ is one of them. In view, then, 
of the objections to Feeling, something else, some special mode 
of mental activity, had to be found, to which Beauty could belong. 
Hence arose the æsthetic mode. Truth was the object of the inquiring 
activity, of the Intellectual or Theoretical part of the mind, 
and the Good that of the willing, desiring, practical part; what 
part could be found for the Beautiful? Some activity that was 
neither inquisitive nor practical, that did not question and 
did not seek to use. The result was the æsthetic, the contemplative, 
activity which is still defined, in most treatments<a id="note2.4text"></a><a href="#note2.4">†</a>, by these 
negative conditions alone, as that mode of commerce with things 
which is neither intellectual inquiry into their nature, nor 
an attempt to make them satisfy our desire. The experiences which 
arise in contemplating objects of art were then discovered to 
be describable in some such terms, and system secured a temporary 
triumph. </p>

<p>It is true that many of these experiences do present peculiarities, 
both in the intellectual interest which is present and in the 
way in which the development of desires within them takes place, 
and these peculiarities—detachment, impersonality, serenity and 
so forth—are of great interest. They will have to be carefully 
examined in the sequel. </p>

<p>We shall find that two entirely different sets of characters 
are involved. They arise from quite different causes but are 
hard to distinguish introspectively. Taken as marking off a special 
province for inquiry they are most unsatisfactory. They would 
yield for our purposes, even if they were not so ambiguous, a 
diagonal or slant classification. Some of the experiences which 
most require to be considered would be left out and many which 
are without importance brought in. To choose the Æsthetic State 
as the starting-point for an inquiry into the values of the arts 
is in fact somewhat like choosing ‘rectangular, and red in parts’ 
as a definition of a picture. We should find ourselves ultimately 
discussing a different collection of things from those we intended 
to discuss. </p>

<p>But the problem remains—Is there any such thing as the æsthetic 
state, or any æsthetic character of experiences which is <i>sui 
generis</i>? Not many explicit arguments have ever been given 
for one. Vernon Lee, it is true, in <i>Beauty and Ugliness</i>, 
p. 10, argues that “a relation entirely <i>sui generis</i> between 
visible and audible forms and ourselves” can be deduced from 
the fact “that given proportions, shapes, patterns, compositions 
have a tendency to recur in art.” How this can be done it is 
hard to divine. Arsenic tends to recur in murder cases, and tennis 
in the summer, but no characters or relations <i>sui generis</i> 
anywhere are thereby proved. Obviously you can only tell whether 
anything is like or unlike other things by examining it and them, 
and to notice that one case of it is like another case of it, 
is not helpful. It may be suspected that where the argument is 
so confused, the original question was not very clear. </p>

<p>The question is whether a certain kind of experience is or is 
not <i>like</i> other kinds of experience. Plainly it is a question 
as to degree of likeness. Be it granted at once, to clear the 
air, that there are all sorts of experiences involved in the 
values of the arts, and that attributions of Beauty spring from 
all sorts of causes. Is there among these one kind of experience 
as different from experiences which don’t so occur as, say envy 
is from remembering, or as mathematical calculation is from eating 
cherries? And what degree of difference would make it specific? 
Put this way it is plainly not an easy question to answer. These 
differences, none of them measurable, are of varying degree, 
and all are hard to estimate. Yet the vast majority of post-Kantian 
writers, and many before him, have unhesitatingly replied, “Yes! 
the æsthetic experience is peculiar and specific.” And their 
grounds, when not merely verbal, have usually been those of direct 
inspection. </p>

<p>It requires some audacity to run counter to such a tradition, 
and I do not do so without reflection. Yet, after all, the matter 
is one of classification, and when so many other divisions in 
psychology are being questioned and re-organised, this also may 
be re-examined. </p>

<p>The case for a distinct æsthetic species of experience can take 
two forms. It may be held that there is some unique kind of mental 
element which enters into æsthetic experiences and into no others. 
Thus Mr Clive Bell used to maintain the existence of an unique 
emotion ‘æsthetic emotion’ as the <i>differentia</i>. But psychology 
has no place for such an entity. What other will be suggested? 
Empathy, for example, as Vernon Lee herself insists, enters into 
innumerable other experiences as well as into æsthetic experiences. 
I do not think any will be proposed. </p>

<p>Alternatively, the æsthetic experience may contain no unique 
constituent, and be of the usual stuff but with a special form. 
This is what it is commonly supposed to be. Now the special form 
as it is usually described—in terms of disinterestedness, detachment, 
distance, impersonality, subjective universality, and so forth—this 
form, I shall try to show later, is sometimes no more than a 
consequence of the incidence of the experience, a condition or 
an effect of communication. But sometimes a structure which can 
be described in the same terms is an essential feature of the 
experience, the feature in fact upon which its value depends. 
In other words, at least two different sets of characters, due 
to different causes, are, in current usage, ambiguously covered 
by the term ‘æsthetic.’ It is very necessary to distinguish the 
sense in which merely putting something in a frame or writing 
it in verse gives it an ‘æsthetic character,’ from a sense in 
which value is implied. This confusion, together with other confusions,<a id="note2.5text"></a><a href="#note2.5">*</a> 
has made the term nearly useless. </p>

<p>The æsthetic mode is generally supposed to be a peculiar way 
of regarding things which can be exercised, whether the resulting 
experiences are valuable, disvaluable or indifferent. It is intended 
to cover the experience of ugliness as well as that of beauty, 
and also intermediate experiences. What I wish to maintain is 
that there is no such mode, that the experience of ugliness has 
nothing in common with that of beauty, which both do not share 
with innumerable other experiences no one (except Croce; but 
this qualification is often required) would dream of calling 
æsthetic. But a narrower sense of æsthetic is also found in which 
it <i>is</i> confined to experiences of beauty and does imply 
value. And with regard to this, while admitting that such experiences 
can be distinguished, I shall be at pains to show that they are 
closely similar to many other experiences, that they differ chiefly 
in the connections between their constituents, and that they 
are only a further development, a finer organisation of ordinary 
experiences, and not in the least a new and different kind of 
thing. When we look at a picture, or read a poem, or listen to 
music, we are not doing something quite unlike what we were doing 
on our way to the Gallery or when we dressed in the morning. 
The fashion in which the experience is caused in us is different, 
and as a rule the experience is more complex and, if we are successful, 
more unified. But our activity is not of a fundamentally different 
kind. To assume that it is, puts difficulties in the way of describing 
and explaining it, which are unnecessary and which no one has 
yet succeeded in overcoming. </p>

<p>The point here raised, and particularly the distinction between 
the two quite different sets of characters, on the ground of 
which an experience may be described as æsthetic or impersonal 
and disinterested, will become clearer at a later stage.<a id="note2.6text"></a><a href="#note2.6">*</a> </p>

<br>

<p>A further objection to the assumption of a peculiar æsthetic 
attitude is that it makes smooth the way for the idea of a peculiar 
æsthetic value, a pure art value. Postulate a peculiar kind: 
of experience, æsthetic experience, and it is an easy step to 
the postulation of a peculiar unique value, different in kind 
and cut off from the other values of ordinary experiences. “To 
appreciate a work of art we need bring with us nothing from life, 
no knowledge of its ideas and affairs, no familiarity with its 
emotions.”<a id="note2.7text"></a><a href="#note2.7">†</a> So runs a recent extreme statement of the Æsthetic 
Hypothesis, which has had much success. To quote another example 
less drastic but also carrying with it the implication that æsthetic 
experiences are <i>sui generis</i>, and their value not of the 
same kind as other values. “Its nature is to be not a part, nor 
yet a copy, of the real world (as we commonly understand that 
phrase), but a world in itself independent, complete, autonomous.”<a id="note2.8text"></a><a href="#note2.8">†</a> </p>

<p>This view of the arts as providing a private heaven for æsthetes 
is, as will appear later, a great impediment to the investigation 
of their value. The effects upon the general attitudes of those 
who accept it uncritically are also often regrettable; while 
the effects upon literature and the arts have been noticeable, 
in a narrowing and restriction of the interests active, in preciousness, 
artificiality and spurious aloofness. <img alt="Art" src="images/art.jpg" style="height: 1em;" id="art"> envisaged as a mystic, 
ineffable virtue is a close relative of the ‘æsthetic mood’, 
and may easily be pernicious in its effects, through the habits 
of mind which, as an idea, it fosters, and to which, as a mystery, 
it appeals. </p>

<h2><a href="#chap03" id="chap03"></a>CHAPTER III <br><br>

<span class="smcap">The Language of Criticism</span></h2>
<div class="epigraph"><div class="poetry">
<p style="text-indent: 35%;">. . . . I too have seen </p>
<p style="text-indent: 0%; padding-left:10%">My vision of the rainbow Aureoled face <br>

Divinely fugitive, that haunts the world. . . . </p>
<p style="text-indent: 0%; text-align: right;"><i>The Dominion of Dreams</i>. </p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Whatever</span> the disadvantages of modern æsthetics as a basis for 
a theory of Criticism, the great advance made upon prescientific 
speculation into the nature of Beauty must also be recognised. 
That paralysing apparition Beauty, the ineffable, ultimate, unanalysable, 
simple Idea, has at least been dismissed and with her have departed 
or will soon depart a flock of equally bogus entities. Poetry 
and inspiration together, it is true, still dignify respectable 
quarters with their presence. </p>

<p>“Poetry, like life, is one thing. . . . Essentially a continuous 
substance or energy, poetry is historically a connected movement, 
a series of successive integrated manifestations. Each poet, 
from Homer or the predecessors of Homer to our own day, has been, 
to some degree and at some point, the voice of the movement and 
energy of poetry; in him, poetry has for the moment become visible, 
audible, incarnate; and his extant poems are the record left 
of that partial and transitory incarnation. . . . The progress 
of poetry, with its vast power and exalted function, is immortal.”<a id="note3.1text"></a><a href="#note3.1">†</a> </p>

<p>A diligent search will still find many other Mystic Beings, for 
the most part of a less august nature, sheltering in verbal thickets. 
Construction, Design, Form, Rhythm, Expression . . . are more 
often than not mere <i>vacua</i> in discourse, for which a theory 
of criticism should provide explainable substitutes. </p>

<p>While current attitudes to language persist, this difficulty 
of the linguistic phantom must still continue. It has to be recognised 
that all our natural turns of speech are misleading, especially 
those we use in discussing works of art. We become so accustomed 
to them that even when we are aware that they are ellipses, it 
is easy to forget the fact. And it has been extremely difficult 
in many cases to discover that any ellipsis is present. We are 
accustomed to say that a picture is beautiful, instead of saying 
that it causes an experience in us which is valuable in certain 
ways.<a id="note3.2text"></a><a href="#note3.2">*</a> The discovery that the remark, “This is beautiful”, 
must be turned round and expanded in this way before it is anything 
but a mere noise signalling the fact that we approve of the picture, 
was a great and difficult achievement. Even to-day, such is the 
insidious power of grammatical forms, the belief that there is 
such a quality or attribute, namely Beauty, which attaches to 
the things which we rightly call beautiful, is probably inevitable 
for all reflective persons at a certain stage of their mental 
development. </p>

<p>Even among those who have escaped from this delusion and are 
well aware that we continually talk as though things possess 
qualities, when what we ought to say is that they cause effects 
in us of one kind or another, the fallacy of ‘projecting’ the 
effect and making it a quality of its cause tends to recur. When 
it does so it gives a peculiar obliquity to thought and although 
few competent persons are nowadays so deluded as actually to 
hold the mystical view that there is a quality Beauty which inheres 
or attaches to external objects, yet throughout all the discussion 
of works of art the drag exercised by language towards this view 
can be felt. It perceptibly increases the difficulty of innumerable 
problems and we shall have constantly to allow for it. Such terms 
as ‘construction’, ‘form’, ‘balance’, ‘composition’, ‘design’, 
‘unity’, ‘expression’, for all the arts; as ‘depth’, ‘movement’, 
‘texture’, ‘solidity’, in the criticism of painting; as ‘rhythm’, 
‘stress’, ‘plot’, ‘character’, in literary criticism; as ‘harmony’, 
‘atmosphere’, ‘development’, in music, are instances. All these 
terms are currently used as though they stood for qualities inherent 
in things outside the mind, as a painting, in the sense of an 
assemblage of pigments, is undoubtedly outside the mind. Even 
the difficulty of discovering, in the case of poetry, what thing 
other than print and paper is there for these alleged qualities 
to belong to, has not checked the tendency. </p>

<p>But indeed language has succeeded until recently in hiding from 
us almost all the things we talk about. Whether we are discussing 
music, poetry, painting, sculpture or architecture, we are forced 
to speak as though certain physical objects—vibrations of strings 
and of columns of air, marks printed on paper, canvasses and 
pigments, masses of marble, fabrics of freestone, are what we 
are talking about. And yet the remarks we make as critics do 
not apply to such objects but to states of mind, to experiences. </p>

<p>A certain strangeness about this view is often felt but diminishes 
with reflection. If anyone says that ‘The May Queen’ is sentimental, 
it is not difficult to agree that he is referring to a state 
of mind. But if he declares that the masses in a Giotto exactly 
balance one another, this is less apparent, and, if he goes on 
to discuss time in music, form in visual art, plot in drama, 
the fact that he is all the while talking about mental happenings 
becomes concealed. The verbal apparatus comes between us and 
the things with which we are really dealing. Words which are 
useful, indeed invaluable, as handy stop-gaps and makeshifts 
in conversation, but which need elaborate expansions before they 
can be used with precision, are treated as simply as people’s 
proper names. So it becomes natural to seek for the things these 
words appear to stand for, and thus arise innumerable subtle 
investigations, doomed <i>ab initio</i> as regards their main 
intent to failure. </p>

<br>

<p>We must be prepared then to translate, into phrases pedantic 
and uncouth, all the too simple utterances which the conversational 
decencies exact. We shall find later, in their peculiar emotive 
power the main reason why, in spite of all manner of confusions 
and inconveniences, these current ways of speaking are retained. 
For emotive purposes they are indispensable, but for clarity, 
for the examination of what is actually happening, translations 
are equally a necessity. </p>

<p>Most critical remarks state in an abbreviated form that an object 
causes certain experiences, and as a rule the form of the statement 
is such as to suggest that the object has been said to possess 
certain qualities. But often the critic goes further and affirms 
that the effect in his mind is due to special particular features 
of the object. In this case he is pointing out something about 
the object in addition to its effect upon him, and this fuller 
kind of criticism is what we desire. Before his insight can greatly 
benefit, however, a very clear demarcation between the object, 
with its features, and his experience, which is the effect of 
contemplating it, is necessary. The bulk of critical literature 
is unfortunately made up of examples of their confusion. </p>

<p>It will be convenient at this point to introduce two definitions. 
In a full critical statement which states not only that an experience 
is valuable in certain ways, but also that it is caused by certain 
features in a contemplated object, the part which describes the 
value of the experience we shall call the <i>critical</i> part. 
That which describes the object we shall call the <i>technical</i> 
part. Thus to say that we feel differently towards wooden crosses 
and stone crosses is a technical remark. And to say that metre 
is more suited to the tender passion than is prose would be, 
as it stands, a technical remark, but here it is evident that 
a critical part might easily be also present. All remarks as 
to the ways and means by which experiences arise or are brought 
about are technical, but critical remarks are about the values 
of experiences and the reasons for regarding them as valuable, 
or not valuable. We shall endeavor in what follows to show that 
critical remarks are merely a branch of psychological remarks, 
and that no special ethical or metaphysical ideas need be introduced 
to explain value. </p>

<p>The distinction between technical and critical remarks is of 
real importance. Confusion here is responsible for some most 
curious passages in the histories of the arts. A certain technique 
in certain cases produces admirable results; the obvious features 
of this technique come to be regarded at first as sure signs 
of excellence, and later as the excellence itself. For a while 
nothing, however admirable, which does not show these superficial 
marks, gets fair consideration. Thomas Rymer’s denigration of 
Shakespeare, Dr Johnson’s view of Milton’s pauses, the aftermath 
of the triumph of Pope, archaistic sculpture, the Greek poses 
in the compositions of David, the imitations of Cézanne, are 
famous instances; they could be multiplied indefinitely. The 
converse case is equally common. An obvious technical blemish 
in a special case is recognised. It may be too many S’s in a 
particular line, or the irregularity and rimelessness of a ‘Pindaric’ 
Ode; henceforth any line superficially similar, </p>

<div class="poetry"><p style="text-align: center; text-indent:0em; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: .5em; margin-bottom: .5em;">The lustre of the long convolvulusses, </p></div>

<p class="noindent">any unrhymed lyric, is regarded as defective. This trick of judging 
the whole by the detail, instead of the other way about, of mistaking 
the means for the end, the technique for the value, is in fact 
much the most successful of the snares which waylay the critic. 
Only the teacher knows (and sometimes he is guilty himself) how 
great is the number of readers who think, for example, that a 
defective rime—bough’s house, bush thrush, blood good—is sufficient 
ground for condemning a poem in the neglect of all other considerations. 
Such sticklers, like those with a scansion obsession (due as 
a rule to Exercises in Latin Verse), have little understanding 
of poetry. We pay attention to externals when we do not know 
what else to do with a poem. </p>

<h2><a href="#chap04" id="chap04"></a>CHAPTER IV <br><br>

<span class="smcap">Communication and the Artist</span></h2>
<div class ="epigraph">
<p style="text-align: center; text-indent:0em">Poetry is the record of the best and happiest moments of the happiest <br>
and best minds.—<i>The Defence of Poetry</i>. </p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> two pillars upon which a theory of criticism must rest are 
an account of value and an account of communication. We do not 
sufficiently realise how great a part of our experience takes 
the form it does, because we are social beings and accustomed 
to communication from infancy. That we acquire many of our ways 
of thinking and feeling from parents and others is, of course, 
a commonplace. </p>

<p>But the effects of communication go much deeper than this. The 
very structure of our minds largely determined by the fact that 
man has been engaged in communicating for so many hundreds of 
thousands of years, throughout the course of his human development 
and beyond even that. A large part of the distinctive features 
of the mind are due to its being an instrument for communication. 
An experience has to be formed, no doubt, before it is communicated, 
but it takes the form it does largely because it may have to 
be communicated. The emphasis which natural selection has put 
upon communicative ability is overwhelming. </p>

<p>There are very many problems of psychology, from those with which 
some of the exponents of <i>Gestalt theorie</i> are grappling 
to those by which psycho-analysts are bewildered, for which this 
neglected, this almost overlooked aspect of the mind may provide 
a key, but it is pre-eminently in regard to the arts that it 
is of service. For the arts are the supreme form of the communicative 
activity. As we shall see, most of the difficult and obscure 
points about the structures of the arts, for example the priority 
of formal elements to content,<a id="note4.1text"></a><a href="#note4.1">*</a> or the impersonality and detachment 
so much stressed by æstheticians, become easily intelligible 
as soon as we consider them from this angle. But a possible misunderstanding 
must be guarded against. Although it is as a communicator that 
it is most profitable to consider the artist, it is by no means 
true that he commonly looks upon himself in this light. In the 
course of his work he is not as a rule deliberately and consciously 
engaged in a communicative endeavour. When asked, he is more 
likely than not to reply that communication is an irrelevant 
or at best a minor issue, and that what he is making is something 
which is beautiful in itself, or satisfying to him personally, 
or something expressive, in a more or less vague sense, of his 
emotions, or of himself, something personal and individual. That 
other people are going to study it, and to receive experiences 
from it may seem to him a merely accidental, inessential circumstance. 
More modestly still, he may say that when he works he is merely 
amusing himself. </p>

<p>That the artist is not as a mule consciously concerned with communication, 
but with getting the work, the poem or play or statue or painting 
or whatever it is, ‘right’, apparently regardless of its communicative 
efficacy, is easily explained. To make the work ‘embody’, accord 
with, and represent the precise experience upon which its value 
depends is his major preoccupation, in difficult cases an overmastering 
preoccupation, and the dissipation of attention which would be 
involved if he considered the communicative side as a separate 
issue would be fatal in most serious work. He cannot stop to 
consider how the public or even how especially well qualified 
sections of the public may like it or respond to it. He is wise, 
therefore, to keep all such considerations out of mind altogether. 
Those artists and poets who can be suspected of close separate 
attention to the communicative aspect tend (there are exceptions 
to this, of which Shakespeare might be one) to fall into a subordinate 
rank. </p>

<p>But this conscious neglect of communication does not in the least 
diminish the importance of the communicative aspect. It would 
only do so if we were prepared to admit that only our conscious 
activities matter. The very process of getting the work ‘right’ 
has itself, so far as the artist is normal,<a id="note4.2text"></a><a href="#note4.2">*</a> immense communicative 
consequences. Apart from certain special cases, to be discussed 
later, it will, when ‘right’, have much greater communicative 
power than it would have had if ‘wrong’. The degree to which 
it accords with the relevant experience of the artist is a measure 
of the degree to which it will arouse similar experiences in 
others. </p>

<p>But more narrowly the reluctance of the artist to consider communication 
as one of his main aims, and his denial that he is at all influenced 
in his’ work by a desire to affect other people, is no evidence 
that communication is not actually his principal object. On a 
simple view of psychology, which overlooked unconscious motives, 
it would be, but not on any view of human behaviour which is 
in the least adequate. When we find the artist constantly struggling 
towards impersonality, towards a structure for his work which 
excludes his private, eccentric, momentary idiosyncrasies, and 
using always as its basis those elements which are most uniform 
in their effects upon impulses; when we find private works of 
art, works which satisfy the artist,<a id="note4.3text"></a><a href="#note4.3">*</a> but are incomprehensible 
to everybody else, so rare, and the publicity of the work so 
constantly and so intimately bound up with its appeal to the 
artist himself, it is difficult to believe that efficacy for 
communication is not a main part of the ‘rightness’<a id="note4.4text"></a><a href="#note4.4">*</a> which 
the artist may suppose to be something quite different. </p>

<p>How far desire actually to communicate, as distinguished from 
desire to produce something with communicative efficacy (however 
disguised), is an ‘unconscious motive’ in the artist is a question 
to which we need not hazard an answer. Doubtless individual artists 
vary enormously. To some the lure of ‘immortality’ of enduring 
fame, of a permanent place in the influences which govern the 
human mind, appears to be very strong. To others it is often 
negligible. The degree to which such notions are avowed certainly 
varies with current social and intellectual fashions. At present 
the appeal to posterity, the ‘nurslings of immortality’ attitude 
to works of art appears to be much out of favour. “How do we 
know what posterity will be like? They may be awful people!” 
a contemporary is likely to remark, thus confusing the issue. 
For the appeal is not to posterity merely as living at a certain 
date, but as especially qualified to judge, a qualification most 
posterities have lacked. </p>

<p>What concerns criticism is not the avowed or unavowed motives 
of the artist, however interesting these may be to psychology, 
but the fact that his procedure does, in the majority of instances, 
make the communicative efficacy of his work correspond with his 
own satisfaction and sense of its rightness. This may be due 
merely to his normality, or it may be due to unavowed motives. 
The first suggestion is the more plausible. In any case it is 
certain that no mere careful study of communicative possibilities, 
together with any desire to communicate, however intense, is 
ever sufficient without close natural correspondence between 
the poet’s impulses and possible impulses in his reader. All 
supremely successful communication involves this correspondence, 
and no planning can take its place. Nor is the deliberate conscious 
attempt directed to communication so successful as the unconscious 
indirect method. </p>

<p>Thus the artist is entirely justified in his apparent neglect 
of the main purpose of his work. And when in what follows he 
is alluded to without qualification as being primarily concerned 
with communication, the reservations here made should be recalled. </p>

<br>

<p>Since the poet’s unconscious motives have been alluded to, it 
may be well at this point to make a few additional remarks. Whatever 
psycho-analysts may aver, the mental processes of the poet are 
not a very profitable field for investigation. They offer far 
too happy a hunting-ground for uncontrollable conjecture. Much 
that goes to produce a poem is, of course, unconscious. Very 
likely the unconscious processes are more important than the 
conscious, but even if we knew far more than we do about how 
the mind works, the attempt to display the inner working of the 
artist’s mind by the evidence of his work alone must be subject 
to the gravest dangers. And to judge by the published work of 
Freud upon Leonardo da Vinci or of Jung upon Goethe (e.g. <i>The 
Psychology of the Unconscious</i>, p. 305), psycho-analysts tend 
to be peculiarly inept as critics. </p>

<p>The difficulty is that nearly all speculations as to what went 
on in the artist’s mind are unverifiable, even more unverifiable 
than the similar speculations as to the dreamer’s mind. The most 
plausible explanations are apt to depend upon features whose 
actual causation is otherwise. I do not know whether anyone but 
Mr Graves has attempted to analyse <i>Kubla Khan</i>, a poem 
which by its mode of composition and by its subject suggests 
itself as well fitted for analysis. The reader acquainted with 
current methods of analysis can imagine the results of a thoroughgoing 
Freudian onslaught. </p>

<p>If he will then open <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Book IV at line 223, 
and read onwards: for sixty lines, he will encounter the actual 
sources of not a few of the images and phrases of the poem. In

<p class="noindent">and one of the most cryptic points in Coleridge’s poem, the Abyssinian 
maid, singing of Mount Abora, finds its simple explanation. The 
closing line of the poem perhaps hardly needs this kind of derivation. </p>

<p>From one source or another almost all the matter of <i>Kubla 
Khan</i> came to Coleridge in a similar fashion. I do not know 
whether this particular indebtedness has been remarked before, 
but <i>Purchas his Pilgrimage</i>, Bartram’s <i>Travels in North 
and South Carolina</i>, and Maurice’s <i>History of Hindostan</i> 
are well-known sources, some of them indicated by Coleridge himself. </p>

<p>This very representative instance of the unconscious working 
of a poet’s mind may serve as a not inapposite warning against 
one kind at least of possible applications of psychology in criticism. </p>

<br>

<p>The extent to which the arts and their place in the whole scheme 
of human affairs have been misunderstood, by Critics, Moralists, 
Educators, Æstheticians . . . is somewhat difficult to explain. 
Often those who most misunderstood have been perfect in their 
taste and ability to respond, Ruskin for example. Those who both 
knew what to do with a work of art and also understood what they 
were doing, have been for the most part artists and little inclined 
for, or capable of, the rather special task of explaining. It 
may have seemed to them too obvious to need explanation. Those 
who have tried have as a rule been foiled by language. For the 
difficulty which has always prevented the arts from being explained 
as well as ‘enjoyed’ (to use an inadequate word in default of 
an adequate) is language. </p>

<div class="poetry"><p style="padding-left:15%; text-indent:0em; margin-top:.3em; margin-bottom:.3em">“Happy who can <br>
Appease this virtuous enemy of man!” </p></div>

<p>It was perhaps never so necessary as now that we should know 
why the arts are important and avoid inadequate answers. It will 
probably become increasingly more important in the future. Remarks 
such as these, it is true, are often uttered by enthusiastic 
persons, and are apt to be greeted with the same smile as the 
assertion that the future of England is bound up with Hunting. 
Yet their full substantiation will be found to involve issues 
which are nowhere lightly regarded. </p>

<p>The arts are our storehouse of recorded values. They spring from 
and perpetuate hours in the lives of exceptional people, when 
their control and command of experience is at its highest, hours 
when the varying possibilities of existence are most clearly 
seen and the different activities which may arise are most exquisitely 
reconciled, hours when habitual narrowness of interests or confused 
bewilderment are replaced by an intricately wrought composure. 
Both in the genesis of a work of art, in the creative moment, 
and in its aspect as a vehicle of communication, reasons can 
be found for giving to the arts a very important place in the 
theory of Value. They record the most important judgments we 
possess as to the values of experience. They form a body of 
evidence which, for lack of a serviceable psychology by which 
to interpret it, and through the desiccating influence of abstract 
Ethics, has been left almost untouched by professed students 
of value. An odd omission, for without the assistance of the 
arts we could compare very few of our experiences, and without 
such comparison we could hardly hope to agree as to which are 
to be preferred. Very simple experiences—a cold bath in an enamelled 
tin, or running for a train—may to some extent be compared without 
elaborate vehicles; and friends exceptionally well acquainted 
with one another may manage some rough comparisons in ordinary 
conversation. But subtle or recondite experiences are for most 
men incommunicable and indescribable, though social conventions 
or terror of the loneliness of the human situation may make us 
pretend the contrary. In the arts we find the record in the only 
form in which these things can be recorded of the experiences 
which have seemed worth having to the most sensitive and discriminating 
persons. Through the obscure perception of this fact the poet 
has been regarded as a seer and the artist as a priest, suffering 
from usurpations. The arts, if rightly approached, supply the 
best data available for deciding what experiences are more valuable 
than others. The qualifying clause is all-important however. 
Happily there is no lack of glaring examples to remind us of 
the difficulty of approaching them rightly. </p>

<span class="smcap">The Critics’ Concern with Value</span></h2>
<div class="epigraph"><div class="poetry">
<p style="text-indent: 0%; padding-left:10%">What hinders? Are you beam-blind, yet to a fault <br>
In a neighbour deft-handed? Are you that liar? <br>
And cast by conscience out, spendsavour salt? </p>
<p style="text-indent: 0%; text-align: right;"><i>Gerard Hopkins</i>. </p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Between</span> the general inquiry into the nature of the good and the 
appreciation of particular works of art, there may seem to be 
a wide gap, and the discussion upon which we are about to embark 
may appear a roundabout way of approaching our subject. Morals 
have often been treated, especially in recent times, as a side-issue 
for criticism, from which the special concern of the critic must 
be carefully separated. His business, so it has been said, is 
with the work of art in itself, not with any consequences which 
lie outside it. These may be left, it has been supposed, to others 
for attention, to the clergy perhaps or to the police. </p>

<p>That these authorities are sadly incompetent is a minor disadvantage. 
Their blunderings are as a rule so ridiculous that the effects 
are brief. They often serve a useful purpose in calling attention 
to work which might be overlooked. What is more serious is that 
these indiscretions, vulgarities and absurdities encourage the 
view that morals have little or nothing to do with the arts, 
and the even more unfortunate opinion that the arts have no connection 
with morality. The ineptitudes of censors, their choice of censorable 
objects, ignoble blasphemy, such as that which declared <i>Esther 
Waters</i> an impure book, displays of such intelligence as considered 
<i>Madame Bovary</i> an apology for adulterous wrong, innumerable 
comic, stupefying, enraging interferences fully explain this 
attitude, but they do not justify it. </p>

<p>The common avoidance of all discussion of the wider social and 
moral aspects of the arts by people of steady judgment and strong 
heads is a misfortune, for it leaves the field free for folly, 
and cramps the scope of good critics unduly. So loath have they 
been to be thought at large with the wild asses that they have 
virtually shut themselves up in a paddock. If the competent are 
to refrain because of the antics of the unqualified, an evil 
and a loss which are neither temporary nor trivial increase continually. 
It is as though medical men were all to retire because of the 
impudence of quacks. For the critic is as closely occupied with 
the health of the mind as the doctor with the health of the body. 
In a different way, it is true, and with a wider and subtler 
definition of health, by which the healthiest mind is that capable 
of securing the greatest amount of value. </p>

<p>The critic cannot possibly avoid using some ideas about value. 
His whole occupation is an application and exercise of his ideas 
on the subject, and an avoidance of moral preoccupations on his 
part can only be either an abdication or a rejection under the 
title of ‘morality’ of what he considers to be mistaken or dishonest 
ideas and methods. The term has a dubious odour, it has been 
handled by many objectionable as well as admirable people, and 
we may agree to avoid it. But the errors exemplified by censorship 
exploits are too common, and misconceptions as to the nature 
of value too easy to fall into and too widespread, for useful 
criticism to remain without a general theory and an explicit 
set of principles. </p>

<p>What is needed is a defensible position for those who believe 
that the arts are of value. Only a general theory of value which 
will show the place and function of the arts in the whole system 
of values will provide such a stronghold. At the same time we 
need weapons with which to repel and overthrow misconceptions. 
With the increase of population the problem presented by the 
gulf between what is preferred by the majority and what is accepted 
as excellent by the most qualified opinion has become infinitely 
more serious and appears likely to become threatening in the 
near future. For many reasons standards are much more in need 
of defence than they used to be. It is perhaps premature to envisage 
a collapse of values, a transvaluation by which popular taste 
replaces trained discrimination. Yet commercialism has done stranger 
things: we have not yet fathomed the more sinister potentialities 
of the cinema and the loud-speaker, and there is some evidence, 
uncertain and slight no doubt, that such things as ‘best-sellers’ 
(compare <i>Tarzan</i> with <i>She</i>), magazine verses, mantelpiece 
pottery, Academy pictures, Music Hall songs, County Council buildings, 
War Memorials . . . are decreasing in merit. Notable exceptions, 
in which the multitude are better advised than the experts, of 
course occur sometimes, but not often. </p>

<p>To bridge the gulf, to bring the level of popular appreciation 
nearer to the consensus of best qualified opinion, and to defend 
this opinion against damaging attacks (Tolstoy’s is a typical 
example), a much clearer account than has yet been produced, 
of why this opinion is right, is essential. These attacks are 
dangerous, because they appeal to a natural instinct, hatred 
of ‘superior persons’. The expert in-matters of taste is in an 
awkward position when he differs from the majority. He is forced 
to say in effect, “I am better than you. My taste is more refined, 
my nature more cultured, you will do well to become more like 
me than you are.” It is not his fault that he has to be so arrogant. 
He may, and usually does, disguise the fact as far as possible, 
but his claim to be heard as an expert depends upon the truth 
of these assumptions. He ought then to be ready with reasons 
of a clear and convincing kind as to why his preferences are 
worth attention, and until these reasons are forthcoming, the 
accusations that he is a charlatan and a prig are embarrassing. 
He may indeed point to years of preoccupation with his subject, 
he may remark like the wiseacre Longinus, sixteen hundred years 
ago, “The judgment of literature is the final outcome of much 
endeavour,” but with him are many Professors to prove that years 
of endeavour may lead to nothing very remarkable in the end. </p>

<p>To habilitate the critic, to defend accepted standards against 
Tolstoyan attacks, to narrow the interval between these standards 
and popular taste, to protect the arts against the crude moralities 
of Puritans and perverts, a general theory of value, which will 
not leave the statement “This is good, that bad,” either vague 
or arbitrary, must be provided. There is no alternative open. 
Nor is it such an excursus from the inquiry into the nature of 
the arts as may be supposed. For if a well-grounded theory of 
value is a necessity for criticism, it is no less true that an 
understanding of what happens in the arts is needed for the theory. 
The two problems “What is good?” and “What are the arts?” reflect 
light upon one another. Neither in fact can be fully answered 
without the other. </p>

<p>To the unravelling of the first we may now proceed. </p>

<span class="smcap">Value as an Ultimate Idea</span></h2>
<div class ="epigraph">
<p style="text-align: center; text-indent:0em">Some lovely glorious nothing I did see.—<i>Aire and Angels</i>. </p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> has always been found far more easy to divide experiences<a id="note6.1text"></a><a href="#note6.1">*</a> 
into good and bad, valuable and the reverse, than to discover 
what we are doing when we make the division. The history of opinions 
as to what constitutes value, as to why and when anything is 
rightly called good, shows a bewildering variety. But in modern 
times the controversy narrows itself down to two questions. The 
first of these is whether the difference between experiences 
which are valuable and those which are not can be fully described 
in psychological terms; whether some additional distinctive ‘ethical’ 
or ‘moral’ idea of a non-psychological nature is or is not required. 
The second question concerns the exact psychological analysis 
needed in order to explain value if no further ‘ethical’ idea 
is shown to be necessary. </p>

<p>The first question will not detain us long. It has been ably 
maintained<a id="note6.2text"></a><a href="#note6.2">*</a> and widely accepted that when we say that an experience 
is good we are simply saying that it is endowed with a certain 
ethical property or attribute not to be reduced to any psychological 
properties or attributes such as being desired or approved, and 
that no further elucidation of this special ethical property 
by way of analysis is possible. ‘Good’ on this view is in no 
way a shorthand term for some more explicit account. The things 
which are good, it is held, are just good, possess a property 
which can be recognised by immediate intuition, and here, since 
good is unanalysable, the matter must rest. All that the study 
of value can do is to point out the things which possess this 
property, classify them, and remove certain confusions between 
ends which are good in themselves and means which are only called 
good, because they are instrumental in the attainment of intrinsically 
good ends. Usually those who maintain this view also hold that 
the only things which are good for their own sakes and not merely 
as a means are certain conscious experiences, for example, knowledge, 
admiring contemplation of beauty, and feelings of affection and 
veneration under some circumstances. Other things, such as mountains, 
books, railways, courageous actions, are good instrumentally 
because, and in so far as, they cause or make possible states 
of mind which are valuable intrinsically. Thus the occurrence 
of states of mind which are recognised as good is regarded as 
an isolated fact of experience, not capable of being accounted 
for, or linked up with the rest of human peculiarities as a product 
of development in the way made familiar by the biological sciences. </p>

<p>The plausibility of this view derives principally from the metaphysical 
assumption that there are properties, in the sense of subsistent 
entities, which attach to existent particulars, but which might 
without absurdity be supposed to attach to nothing. </p>

<p>These metaphysical entities, variously named Ideas, Notions, 
Concepts or Universals, may be divided into two kinds, sensuous 
and supersensuous.<a id="note6.3text"></a><a href="#note6.3">†</a> The sensuous are those which may be apprehended 
by the senses, such as ‘red’, ‘cold’, ‘round’, ‘swift’, ‘painful’, 
and the supersensuous, those apprehended not in sensuous perception 
but otherwise. Logical relations, ‘necessity’ or ‘impossibility,’ 
and such ideas as ‘willing’, ‘end’, ‘cause’, and ‘being three 
in number’, have in this way been supposed to be directly apprehensible 
by the mind. Amongst these supersensuous Ideas good is to be 
found. </p>

<p>Nothing could be simpler than such a view, and to many people 
the subsistence of such a property of goodness appears not surprising. 
But to others the suggestion seems merely a curious survival 
of abstractionism, if such a term may be defended by its close 
parallel with obstructionism. A blind man in a dark room chasing 
a black cat which is not there would seem to them well employed 
in comparison with a philosopher apprehending such ‘Concepts’. 
While ready for convenience of discourse to talk and even to 
think as though Concepts and Particulars were separable and distinct 
kinds of entities, they refuse to believe that the structure 
of the world actually contains such a cleavage. The point is 
perhaps undiscussable, and is probably unimportant, except in 
so far as the habit of regarding the world as actually so cloven 
is a fruitful source of bogus entities, usually hypostatised 
words. The temptation to introduce premature ultimates—Beauty 
in Æsthetics, the Mind and its faculties in psychology, Life 
in physiology, are representative examples—is especially great 
for believers in Abstract Entities. The objection to such Ultimates 
is that they bring an investigation to a dead end too suddenly. 
An ultimate Good is, in this instance, just such an arbitrary 
full stop. </p>

<p>It will be agreed that a less cryptic account of good, if one 
can be given, which is in accordance with verifiable facts, would 
be preferable, even though no means were available for refuting 
the simpler theory. Upholders of this theory, however, have produced 
certain arguments to show that no other view of good is possible, 
and these must first be briefly examined. They provide, in addition, 
an excellent example of the misuse of psychological assumptions 
in research, for although a psychological approach is often of 
the utmost service, it can also be a source of obscurantism and 
over-confidence. The arguments against any naturalistic account 
depend upon the alleged results of directly inspecting what is 
before our minds when we judge that anything is good. If we substitute, 
it is maintained, any account of good whatever for ‘good’ in 
the assertion, ‘This is good’—for example, ‘This is desired’ 
or ‘This is approved’—we can detect that what is substituted 
is different from ‘good’, and that we are not then making the 
same judgment. This result, it is claimed, is confirmed by the 
fact that we can always ask, “Is what is desired, or what is 
approved, good?” however we may elaborate the account provided, 
and that this is always a genuine question which would be impossible 
were the substituted account actually the analysis of good. </p>

<p>The persuasiveness of this refutation is found to vary enormously 
from individual to individual, for the results of the experiments 
upon which it relies differ. Those who have accustomed themselves 
to the belief that good is a supersensuous simple Idea readily 
discover the fraudulent character of any offered substitute, 
while those who hold some psychological theory of value, with 
equal ease identify their account with ‘good’. The further question, 
“When and under what conditions can judgments be distinguished?” 
arises, a question so difficult to answer that any argument becomes 
suspect which depends upon assuming that they can be infallibly 
recognised as different. If for any reason we wish to distinguish 
two judgments, we can persuade ourselves, in any case in which 
they are differently formulated, that they are different. Thus 
it has been thought that ‘<i>a</i> exceeds <i>b</i>’ and ‘<i>a</i> 
is greater than <i>b</i>’ are distinguishable, the first being 
supposed to state simply that <i>a</i> has the relation ‘exceeds’ 
to <i>b</i>, while the second is supposed to state that <i>a</i> 
has the relation ‘is’ to <i>greater</i> which again has the relation 
‘than’ to <i>b</i>.<a id="note6.4text"></a><a href="#note6.4">*</a> The conclusion to be drawn from the application 
of such methods to the problem of the meaning of Good would seem 
to be that they are not competent to decide anything about it—by 
no means a valueless result. </p>

<p>Since nothing can be concluded from a comparison of ‘This is 
good’ with, let us say, ‘This is sought by an impulse belonging 
to a dominant group’, let us see whether light can be gained 
by considering analogous instances in which special distinct 
ideas have for a time been thought indispensable only to yield 
later to analysis and substitution. The case of Beauty is perhaps 
too closely related to that of Good for our purpose. Those who 
can persuade themselves that Good is an unique irreducible entity 
might believe the same of Beauty. An episode in the theory of 
the tides is more instructive. It was once thought that the moon 
must have a peculiar Affinity with water: When the moon is full 
the tides are higher. Clearly the seas swell in sympathy with 
the increase of the moon. The history of science is full of mysterious 
unique entities which have gradually evaporated as explanation 
advanced. </p>

<p>The struggles of economists with ‘utility’, of mathematical philosophers 
with ‘points’ and ‘instants’, of biologists with ‘entelechies’, 
and the adventures of psycho-analysts with ‘the libido’ and ‘the 
collective unconscious’ are instances in point. At present theoretical 
psychology in particular is largely made up of the manipulation 
of similar suspects. The Act of Judgment, the relation of Presentation, 
Immediate Awareness, Direct Inspection, the Will, Feeling, Assumption, 
Acceptance, are only a few of the provisional ultimates introduced 
for convenience of discussion. Some of them may in the end prove 
to be indispensable, but meanwhile they are not, to prudent people, 
more than symbolic conveniences; theories dependent upon them 
must not be allowed to shut off from investigation fields which 
may be fruitful. </p>

</div></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> method then by which any attempt to analyse ‘good’ has been 
condemned is itself objectionable, and yields no sound reason 
why a purely psychological account of the differences between 
good, bad, and indifferent experiences should not be given. The 
data for the inquiry are in part supplied by anthropology. It 
has become clear that the disparity among the states of mind 
recognised as good by persons of different races, habits and 
civilisations is overwhelming. Any observant child, it is true, 
might discover in the home circle how widely people disagree, 
but the effect of education is to suppress these scientific efforts. 
It has needed the vast accumulations of anthropological evidence 
now available to establish the fact that as the organisation 
of life and affairs alters very different experiences are perceived 
to be good or bad, are favoured or condemned. The Bakairi of 
Central Brazil and the Tahitians, among others, are reported, 
for example, to look upon eating with the same feelings which 
we reserve for quite different physiological performances, and 
to regard the public consumption of food as a grave breach of 
decency. In many parts of the world feelings of forgiveness towards 
enemies, for example, are looked upon as low and ignoble. The 
experiences which one person values are thought vicious by another. 
We must allow, it is true, for widespread confusion between intrinsic 
and instrumental values, and for the difficulty of identifying 
experiences. Many states of mind in other people which we judge 
to be bad or indifferent are no doubt unlike what we imagine 
them to be, or contain elements which we overlook, so that with 
fuller knowledge we might discover them to be good. In this manner 
it may be possible to reduce the reported disparity of value 
intuitions, but few people acquainted with the varying moral 
judgments of mankind will doubt that circumstances and necessities, 
present and past, explain our approval and disapproval. We start, 
then, with a hearty scepticism of all immediate intuitions, and 
inquire how it is that individuals in different conditions, and 
at different stages of their development, esteem things so differently. </p>

<p>With the exception of some parents and nursemaids we have lately 
all been aghast at revelations of the value judgments of infants. 
Their impulses, their desires, their preferences, the things 
which they esteem, as displayed by the psycho-analysts, strike 
even those whose attitude towards humanity is not idealistic 
with some dismay. Even when the stories are duly discounted, 
enough which is verifiable remains for <i>infans polypervers</i> 
to present a truly impressive figure dominating all future psychological 
inquiry into value. </p>

<p>There is no need here to examine in detail how these early impulses 
are diverted and disguised by social pressures. The rough outlines 
are familiar of the ways in which by growth, by the appearance 
of fresh instinctive tendencies, by increase of knowledge and 
of command over the world, under the control of custom, magical 
beliefs, public opinion, inculcation and example, the primitive 
new-born animal may be gradually transformed into a bishop. At 
every stage in the astonishing metamorphosis, the impulses, desires, 
and propensities of the individual take on a new form, or, it 
may be, a further degree of systematisation. This systematisation 
is never complete. Always some impulse, or set of impulses, can 
be found which in one way or another interferes, or conflicts, 
with others. It may do so in two ways, directly or indirectly. 
Some impulses are in themselves psychologically incompatible, 
some are incompatible only indirectly, through producing contrary 
effects in the world outside. The difficulty some people have 
in smoking and writing at the same time is a typical instance 
of the first kind of incompatibility; the two activities get 
in each other’s way by a psychological accident as it were. Interference 
of this kind can be overcome by practice to an unexpected degree, 
as the feats of jugglers show; some, however, are insurmountable; 
and these incompatibilities are often, as we shall see, of supreme 
consequence in moral development. Indirect incompatibilities 
arising through the consequences of our acts are more easy to 
find. Our whole existence is one long study of them, from the 
infant’s first choice whether he shall use his mouth for screaming 
or for sucking, to the last codicil to his Will. </p>

<p>These are simple instances, but the conduct of life is throughout 
an attempt to organise impulses so that success is obtained for 
the greater number or mass of them, for the most important and 
the weightiest set. And here we come face to face again with 
the problem of value. How shall we decide which among these are 
more important than: others, and how shall we distinguish different 
organisations as yielding more or less value one than another? 
At this point we need to be on our guard not to smuggle in any 
peculiar ethical, non-psychological, idea under some disguise, 
under ‘important’ or ‘fundamental’, for example. </p>

<p>Among those who reject any metaphysical view of value it has 
become usual to define value as capacity for satisfying feeling 
and desire in various intricate ways.<a id="note7.1text"></a><a href="#note7.1">*</a> For the purpose of tracing 
in detail the very subtle and varied modes in which people actually 
value things, a highly intricate treatment is indispensable, 
but here a simpler definition will suffice. </p>

<p>We may start from the fact that impulses may be divided into 
appetencies and aversions, and begin by saying that anything 
is valuable which satisfies an appetency or ‘seeking after.’ 
The term ‘desire’ would do as well if we could avoid the implication 
of accompanying conscious beliefs as to what is sought and a 
further restriction to felt and recognised longings. The term 
‘want’ used so much by economists has the same disadvantages. 
Appetencies may be, and for the most part are, unconscious, and 
to leave out those which we cannot discover by introspection 
would involve extensive errors. For the same reason it is wiser 
not to start from feeling. Appetencies then, rather than felt 
appetencies or desires, shall be our starting-point. </p>

<p>The next step is to agree that apart from consequences anyone 
<i>will actually prefer</i> to satisfy a greater number of equal 
appetencies rather than a less. Observation of people’s behaviour, 
including our own, is probably sufficient to establish this agreement. 
If now we look to see what consequences can intervene to upset 
this simple principle, we shall find that only interferences, 
immediate or remote, direct: or indirect, with other appetencies, 
need to be considered. The only <i>psychological</i> restraints 
upon appetencies are other appetencies.<a id="note7.2text"></a><a href="#note7.2">*</a> </p>

<p>We can now extend our definition. Anything is valuable which 
will satisfy an appetency without involving the frustration of 
some equal or <i>more important</i> appetency; in other words, 
the only reason which can be given for not satisfying a desire 
is that more important desires will thereby be thwarted. Thus 
morals become purely prudential, and ethical codes merely the 
expression of the mast general scheme of expediency<a id="note7.3text"></a><a href="#note7.3">*</a> to which 
an individual or a race has attained. But we have still to say 
what ‘important’ stands for in this formulation. (Cf. p. 51). </p>

<p>There are certain evident priorities among impulses, some of 
which have been studied in various ways by economists under the 
headings of primary wants and secondary wants. Some needs or 
impulses must be satisfied in order that others may be possible. 
We must eat, drink, sleep, breathe, protect ourselves and carry 
on an immense physiological business as a condition for any further 
activities. Some of these impulses, breathing, for example, can 
be satisfied directly, but most of them involve us in complicated 
cycles of instrumental labour. Man for the most part must exert 
himself half his life to satisfy even the primitive needs, and 
these activities, failing other means of reaching the same ends, 
share their priority. In their turn they involve as conditions 
a group of impulses, whose satisfaction becomes only second in 
importance to physiological necessities, those, namely, upon 
which communication and the ability to co-operate depend. But 
these, since man is a social creature, also become more directly 
necessary to his well-being. </p>

<p>The very impulses which enable him to co-operate in gaining his 
dinner would themselves, if not satisfied, wreck by their mere 
frustration all his activities. This happens all through the 
hierarchy. Impulses, whose exercise may have been originally 
only important as means, and which might once have been replaced 
by quite different sets, become in time necessary conditions 
for innumerable quite different performances. Objects, again, 
originally valued because they satisfy one need, are found later 
to be also capable of satisfying others. Dress, for example, 
appears to have originated in magical, ‘life-giving,’ ornaments<a id="note7.4text"></a><a href="#note7.4">†</a>, 
but so many other interests derive satisfaction from it that 
controversy can still arise as to its primitive uses. </p>

<p>The instances of priorities given must only be taken as examples. 
It is hardly necessary to remind the reader that for a civilised 
man, activities originally valuable as means only, often become 
so important through their connections with the rest of his activities, 
that life without them is regarded as intolerable. Thus acts 
which will debar him from his normal relations with his fellows 
are often avoided, even at the cost of death. Total cessation 
of all activities is preferred to the dreadful thwarting and 
privation which would ensue. The case of the soldier, or of the 
conscientious objector, is thus no exception to the principle. 
Life deprived of all but the barest physiological necessities, 
for example, prison life, is for many people worse than non-existence. 
Those who even so incur it in defence of some ‘moral ideal’ do 
so because they are so organised, either permanently or temporarily, 
that only in this way can their dominant impulses secure satisfaction. 
The self-regarding impulses form only a part of the total activities 
of social man, and the impulse of the martyr to bear witness 
at any cost to what he regards as truth, is only one extreme 
instance of the degree to which other impulses often assume supremacy. </p>

<p>For another reason any priorities mentioned must be taken only 
as illustrations. We do not know enough yet about the precedences, 
the hierarchies, the modes of systematisation, actual and possible, 
in that unimaginable organisation, the mind, to say what order 
in any case actually exists, or between what the order holds. 
We only know that a growing order is the principle of the mind, 
that its function is to co-ordinate, and we can detect that in 
some of its forms the precedence is different from that in others. 
This we could do by observation, by comparing the drunken man 
with the sober, but from our own experience of our own activity 
we can go much further. We can feel differences between clear 
coherent thinking and confusion or stupidity, between free, controlled 
emotional response and dull or clogged impassivity, between moments 
when we do with our bodies more delicate and dexterous things 
than seem possible, and moments of clumsiness, when we are ‘all 
thumbs’, have no ‘balance’ or ‘timing’, and nothing ‘comes off’. 
These differences are differences in momentary organisation, 
differences in precedence between rival possible systematisations. 
The more permanent and more specifically ‘moral’ differences 
between individuals grow out of differences such as these and 
correspond to similar precedences between larger systems. </p>

<p>The complications possible in the systematisation of impulses 
might be illustrated indefinitely. The plasticity of special 
appetencies and activities varies enormously. Some impulses can 
be diverted more easily than others. Sex has a wider range of 
satisfactions than hunger, for example; some are weaker than 
others; some (not the same necessarily) can be suppressed in 
the long run with less difficulty. Some can be modified; some 
obey the ‘all or none’ rule—they must either be satisfied specifically 
or completely inhibited—well-established habits may have this 
peculiarity. In judging the importance of any impulse all these 
considerations must be taken into account. The affiliations of 
impulses, at present often inexplicable, need especially to be 
considered. Within the whole partially systematised organisation, 
numerous sub-systems can be found, and what would be expected 
to be quite trivial impulses are often discovered to be important, 
because they belong to powerful groups. Thus there are reasonable 
persons who, without a high polish on their shoes, are almost 
incapacitated. </p>

<p>The importance of an impulse, it will be seen, can be defined 
for our purposes as <i>the extent of the disturbance of other 
impulses in the individual’s activities which the thwarting of 
the impulse involves</i>. A vague definition, it is true, but 
therefore suitable to our at present incomplete and hazy knowledge 
of how impulses are related. It will be observed that no special 
ethical idea is introduced. We can now take our next step forward 
and inquire into the relative merits of different systematisations. </p>

<p>No individual can live one minute without a very intricate and, 
so far as it goes, very perfect co-ordination of impulses. It 
is only when we pass from the activities which from second to 
second maintain life to those which from hour to hour determine 
what kind of life it shall be, that we find wide differences. 
Fortunately for psychology we can each find wide enough differences 
in ourselves from hour to hour. Most people in the same day are 
Bonaparte and Oblomov by turns. Before breakfast Diogenes, after 
dinner Petronius or Bishop Usher. But throughout these mutations 
certain dispositions usually remain much the same, those which 
govern public behaviour in a limited number of affairs varying 
very greatly from one society or civilisation to another. Every 
systematisation in the degree to which it is stable involves 
a degree of sacrifice, but for some the price to be paid in opportunities 
foregone is greater than for others. By the extent of the loss, 
the range of impulses thwarted or starved, and their degree of 
importance, the merit of a systematisation is judged. That organisation 
which is least wasteful of human possibilities is, in short, 
the best. Some individuals, hag-ridden by their vices, or their 
virtues, to a point at which the law of diminishing returns has 
deprived even these of their appropriate satisfactions, are still 
unable to reorganise; they go through life incapacitated for 
most of its possible enjoyments.<a id="note7.5text"></a><a href="#note7.5">*</a> Others, paralysed with their 
conflicts, are unable to do anything freely; whatever they attempt 
some implicated but baffled impulse is still fitfully and fretfully 
stirring. The debauchee and the victim of conscience alike have 
achieved organisations whose price in sacrifice is excessive. 
Both their individual satisfactions, and those for which they 
are dependent upon sympathetic relations with their fellows, 
an almost equal group, are unduly restricted. Upon grounds of 
prudence alone they have been injudicious, and they may be condemned 
without any appeal to peculiarly ‘ethical’ standards. The muddle 
in which they are forced to live is itself sufficient ground 
for reprobation. </p>

<p>At the other extreme are those fortunate people who have achieved 
an ordered life, whose systems have developed clearing-houses 
by which the varying claims of different impulses are adjusted. 
Their free, untrammelled activity gains for them a maximum of 
varied satisfactions and involves a minimum of suppression and 
sacrifice. Particularly is this so with regard to those satisfactions 
which require humane, sympathetic, and friendly relations between 
individuals. The charge of egoism, or selfishness, can be brought 
against a naturalistic or utilitarian morality such as this only 
by overlooking the importance of these satisfactions in any well-balanced 
life. Unfair or aggressive behaviour, and preoccupation with 
self-regarding interests to the exclusion of due sensitiveness 
to the reciprocal claims of human intercourse, lead to a form 
of organisation which deprives the person so organised of whole 
ranges of important values. No mere loss of social pleasures 
is in question, but a twist or restriction of impulses, whose 
normal satisfaction is involved in almost all the greatest goods 
of life. The two senses in which a man may ‘take advantage’ of 
his fellows can be observed in practice to conflict. Swindling 
and bullying, whether in business matters or in personal relations, 
have their cost; which the best judges agree to be excessive. 
And the greater part of the cost lies of in the consequences 
of being found out, in the loss of social esteem and so forth, 
but in actual systematic disability to attain important values. </p>

<p>Although the person who habitually disregards the claims of his 
fellows to fair treatment and sympathetic understanding may be 
condemned, in most cases, upon the ground of his own actual loss 
of values in such behaviour, this of course is not the reason 
for the steps which may have to be taken against him. It may 
very well be the case that a person’s own interests are such 
that, <i>if he understood them</i>, were well organised in other 
words, he would be a useful and charming member of his community; 
but, so long as people are about who are not well organised, 
communities must protect themselves. They can defend their action 
on the ground that the general loss of value which would follow 
if they did not protect themselves far outweighs such losses 
as are incurred by the people whom they suppress or deport. </p>

<p>To extend this individual morality to communal affairs is not 
difficult. Probably the best brief statement upon the point is 
the following note by Bentham, if we interpret ‘happiness’ in 
his formula not as pleasure but as the satisfaction of impulses. </p>

<p style="text-indent:65%; margin-top:.5em"><i>June</i> 29, 1827. </p>

<p>1. Constantly actual end of action on the part of every individual 
at the moment of action, his greatest happiness, according to 
his view of it at that moment. </p>

<p>2. Constantly proper end of action on the part of every individual 
at the moment of action, his real greatest happiness from that 
moment to the end of life. </p>

<p>3. Constantly proper end of action on the part of every individual 
considered as trustee for the community, of which he is considered 
as a member, the greatest happiness of that same community, in 
so far as it depends upon the interest which forms the bond of 
union between its members.<a id="note7.6text"></a><a href="#note7.6">†</a> </p>

<p>But communities, as is well known, tend to behave in the same 
way to people who are better organised as well as to people who 
are worse organised than the standard of the group. They deal 
with Socrates or Bruno as severely as with Turpin or Bottomley. 
Thus mere interference with ordinary activities is not by itself 
a sufficient justification for excluding from the group people 
who are different and therefore nuisances. The precise nature 
of the difference must be considered, and whether and to what 
degree it is the group, not the exceptional member, which ought 
to be condemned. The extent to which alteration is practicable 
is also relevant, and the problem in particular cases becomes 
very intricate. </p>

<p>But the final court of appeal concerns itself in such cases with 
questions, not of the wishes of majorities, but of the actual 
range and degree of satisfaction which different possible systematisations 
of impulse yield. Resentment at interference and gratitude for 
support and assistance are to be distinguished from disapproval 
and approval. The esteem and respect accorded to persons with 
the social<a id="note7.7text"></a><a href="#note7.7">*</a> virtues well developed is only in a small degree 
due to the use which we find we can make of them. It is much 
more a sense that their lives are rich and full. </p>

<p>When any desire is denied for the sake of another, the approved 
and accepted activity takes on additional value; it is coveted 
and pursued all the more for what it has cost. Thus the spectacle 
of other people enjoying both activities without difficulty, 
thanks to some not very obvious adjustment, is peculiarly distressing, 
and such people are usually regarded as especially depraved. 
In different circumstances this view may or may not be justified. 
The element of sacrifice exacted by any stable system explains 
to a large extent the tenacity with which custom is clung to, 
the intolerance directed sea innovations, the fanaticism of converts, 
the hypocrisy of teachers, and many other lamentable phenomena 
of the moral attitudes. However much an individual may privately 
find his personality varying from hour to hour, he is compelled 
to join in maintaining a public facade of some rigidity and buttressed 
with every contrivance which can be invented. The Wills of Gods, 
the Conscience, the Catechism, Taboos, Immediate Intuitions, 
Penal Laws, Public Opinion, Good Form, are all more or less ingenious 
and efficient devices with the same aim—to secure the uniformity 
which social life requires. By their means and by Custom, Convention, 
and Superstition, the underlying basis of morality, the effort 
to attain maximum satisfaction through coherent systematisation, 
is a veiled and disguised to an extraordinary degree. Whence 
arise great difficulties and many disasters. It is so necessary 
and so difficult to secure a stable and general system of public 
behaviour that any means whatever are justifiable, failing the 
discovery of better. All societies hitherto achieved, however, 
involve waste and misery of appalling extent. </p>

<p>Any public code of behaviour must, it is generally agreed, represent 
a cruder and more costly systematisation than those attained 
to by many of the individuals who live under the code, a point 
obviously to be remembered in connection with censorship problems. 
Customs change more slowly than conditions, and every change 
in conditions brings with it new possibilities of systematisation. 
None of the afflictions of humanity are worse than its obsolete 
moral principles. Consider the effects of the obsolete virtues 
of nationalism under modern conditions, or the absurdity of the 
religious attitude to birth control. The present lack of plasticity 
in such things involves a growing danger. Human conditions and 
possibilities have altered more in a hundred years than they 
had in the previous ten thousand, and the next fifty may overwhelm 
us, unless we can devise a more adaptable morality. The view 
that what we need in this tempestuous turmoil of change is a 
Rock to shelter under or to cling to, pane than an efficient 
aeroplane in which to ride it, is comprehensible but mistaken. </p>

<p>To guard against a possible misunderstanding it may be added 
that the organisation and systematisation of which I have been 
speaking in this chapter are not primarily an affair of conscious 
planning or arrangement, as this is understood, for example, 
by a great business house or by a railway. (Cf. p. 202.) We pass 
as a rule from a chaotic to a better organised state by ways 
which we know nothing about. Typically through the influence 
of other minds. Literature and the arts are the chief means by 
which these influences are diffused. It should be unnecessary 
to insist upon the degree to which high civilisation, in other 
words, free, varied and unwasteful life, depends upon them in 
a numerous society. </p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">From</span> this excursus let us return to our proper task, the attempt 
to outline a morality which will change its values as circumstances 
alter, a morality free from occultism, absolutes and arbitrariness, 
a morality which will explain, as no morality has yet explained, 
the place and value of the arts in human affairs. What is good 
or valuable, we have said, is the exercise of impulses and the 
satisfaction of their appetencies. When we say that anything 
is good we mean that it satisfies, and by a good experience we 
mean one in which the impulses which make it are fulfilled and 
successful, adding as the necessary qualification that their 
exercise and satisfaction shall not interfere in any way with 
more important impulses. Importance we have seen to be a complicated 
matter, and which impulses are by an extensive inquiry into what 
actually happens. The problem of morality then, the problem of 
how we are to obtain the greatest possible value from life, becomes 
a problem of organisation, both in the individual life and in 
the adjustment of individual lives to one another, and is delivered 
from all non-psychological ideas, from absolute goods and immediate 
convictions, which incidentally help greatly to give unnecessary 
stiffness and fixity to obsolescent codes. Without system, needless 
to say, value vanishes, since in a state of chaos important and 
trivial impulses alike are frustrated. </p>

<p>A minor problem may occur here to the reader. It concerns the 
choice between a ‘crowded hour’ and an age without a name, and 
the place of the time factor in valuation. There are many very 
valuable states which cannot last very long in the nature of 
the case, and some of these seem to have disabling consequences. 
But, to take merely the most interesting instance, if we knew 
more about the nervous constitution of genius we might discover 
that the instability from which so many people suffer who are 
at times best able to actualise the possibilities of life is 
merely a consequence of their plasticity; not in the least a 
price which they pay for such ‘high moments,’ but rather a result 
in systems of great delicacy of wear and tear at lower levels 
of adjustment. It is generally those who have the least refined 
views of value who most readily believe that highly valuable 
hours must be paid for afterwards. Their conception of a ‘hectic 
time’ as the summit of human possibilities explains the opinion. 
For those who find that the most valuable experiences are those 
which are also most fruitful of further valuable experiences 
no problem arises. To the query whether they prefer a long life 
to a joyous one, they will reply that they find very satisfactory 
a life which is both. </p>

<p>The most valuable states of mind then are those which involve 
the widest and most comprehensive co-ordination of activities 
and the least curtailment, conflict, starvation and restriction. 
States of mind in general are valuable in the degree in which 
they tend to reduce waste and frustration. We must be careful 
in considering this formulation to remember how varied human 
activities are and avoid, for example, undue admiration for practical 
efficient persons whose emotional life is suppressed. But, thanks 
to the psycho-analysts, we are hardly likely at the moment to 
overlook the consequences of suppressions. </p>

<p>It is plain that no one systematisation can claim a supreme position. 
Men are naturally different and in any society specialisation 
is inevitable. There are evidently a great number of good systematisations 
and what is good for one person will not be good for another. 
A sailor, a doctor, a mathematician and a poet can hardly have 
the same organisation throughout. With different conditions different 
values necessarily arise. Doubtless conditions may be, and too 
often are, such that no life of high value is possible. With 
a naturalistic morality the reasons for altering them and the 
way to do so both become clearer. But even with our present resources 
and command over nature, it is universally agreed that intelligence 
and goodwill could contrive that no man should be so situated 
as to be deprived of all the generally accessible values. The 
clearing away from moral questions of all ethical lumber and 
superstitious interpolations is a step long overdue in this undertaking. 
But until it has been carried further, so it is often thought, 
to be busied with such apparently ‘unpractical’ activities as 
art or criticism is to behave too much like a passenger on a 
short-handed ship. This is true enough doubtless of some who 
so busy themselves. But it is not true that criticism is a luxury 
trade. The rear-guard of society cannot be extricated until the 
vanguard has gone further. Goodwill and intelligence are still 
too little available. The critic, we have said, is as much concerned 
with the health of the mind as any doctor with the health of 
the body. To set up as a critic is to set up as a judge of values. 
What are the other qualifications required we shall see later. 
For the arts are inevitably and quite apart from any intentions 
of the artist an appraisal of existence. Matthew Arnold when 
he said that poetry is a criticism of life was saying something 
so obvious that it is constantly overlooked. The artist is concerned 
with the record and perpetuation of the experiences which seem 
to him most worth having. For reasons which we shall consider 
in Chapter XXII, he is also the man who is most likely to have 
experiences of value to record. He is the point at which the 
growth of the mind shows itself. His experiences those at least 
which give value to his work, represent conciliations of impulses 
which in most minds are still confused, intertrammelled and conflicting. 
His work is the ordering of what in most minds is disordered. 
That his <i>failures</i> to bring order out of chaos are often 
more conspicuous than those of other men is due in part at least 
to his greater audacity; it is a penalty of ambition and a consequence 
of his greater plasticity. But when he succeeds, the value of 
what he has accomplished is found always in a more perfect organisation 
which makes more of the possibilities of response and activity 
available. </p>

<p>What value is and which experiences are most valuable will never 
be understood so long as we think in terms of those large abstractions, 
the virtues and the vices. “You do invert the covenants of her 
trust,” said Comus, that disreputable advocate of Utilitarianism, 
to the Lady, that enemy of Nature. Instead of recognising that 
value lies in the ‘minute particulars’ of response and attitude, 
we have tried to find it in conformity to abstract prescriptions 
and general rules of conduct. The artist is an expert in the 
‘minute particulars’ and <i>qua</i> artist pays little or no 
attention to generalisations which he finds in actual: practice 
are too crude to discriminate between what is valuable and the 
reverse. For this reason the moralist has always tended to distrust 
or to ignore him. Yet since the fine conduct of life springs 
only from fine ordering of responses far too subtle to be touched 
by any general ethical maxims, this neglect of art by the moralist 
has been tantamount to a disqualification. The basis of morality, 
as Shelley insisted, is laid not by preachers but by poets. Bad 
taste and crude responses are not mere flaws in an otherwise 
admirable person. They are actually a root evil from which other 
defects follow. No life can be excellent in which the elementary 
responses are disorganised and confused. </p>

</div></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Every</span> true view, perhaps, has its crude analogues, due sometimes 
to a confused perception of the real state of affairs, sometimes 
to faulty statement. Often these clumsy or mistaken offshoots 
are responsible for the difficulty with which the true view gains 
acceptance. Like shadows, reflections, or echoes, they obscure 
and baffle apprehension. Nowhere are they more inconvenient than 
in the problem of the moral function of art. A consideration 
of some instances will help to make clearer what has been said, 
to distinguish the view recommended from its disreputable relatives 
and to remove possible misapprehensions. </p>

<p>Allusion has several times been made to Tolstoy, and nothing 
in the recent history of æsthetic opinion is so remarkable as 
the onslaught made by that great artist against all the arts. 
No better example could be found of how <i>not</i> to introduce 
moral preoccupations into the judgment of values. Blinded by 
the light of a retarded conversion, knowing, as an artist, the 
extreme importance of the arts, but forgetting in the fierceness 
of his new convictions all the experience that had in earlier 
years made up his own creations, he flung himself, a Principle 
in each hand, upon the whole host of European masterpieces and 
left as he believed hardly a survivor standing. </p>

<p>He begins by emphasising the enormous output of energy which 
is devoted to Art in civilised countries. He then very rightly 
asserts that it is of great importance to know what this activity 
is about; and he devotes thirty pages to the various definitions 
which have been attempted of Art and Beauty. He concludes, after 
ransacking the somewhat uncritical compilations of Schasler and 
Knight, that æsthetics have been hitherto an idle amalgam of 
reverie and phantasy, from which no definition of Art emerges. 
Partly he traces this result to the use in æsthetics of notions 
of beauty; partly to an anxiety in the critics to justify the 
existent forms of Art. They are, he insists, less concerned to 
discover what Art is, than to show that those things which are 
currently termed Art must in fact be Art. To these sections of 
<i>What is Art?</i> assent may be accorded. He then sets out 
his own definition. “To evoke in oneself a sensation which one 
has experienced before, and having evoked it in oneself, to communicate 
this sensation in such a way that others may experience the same 
sensation . . . so that other men are infected by these sensations 
and pass through them; in this does the activity of Art consist.”<a id="note9.1text"></a><a href="#note9.1">†</a> 
So far excellent; if we translate ‘sensation’, the current æsthetico-psychological 
jargon of the art schools in Tolstoy’s day, by some more general 
term such as experience. But this is only a first stage of the 
definition; there are additions to be made. Any Art which is 
infective, as he uses that word in the quotation above, is pure 
Art as opposed to modern or adulterated Art; but in deciding 
the full value of any work of Art we have to consider the nature 
of its contents, the nature, that is, of the experiences communicated. 
The value of art contents is judged, according to Tolstoy, by 
the religious consciousness of the age. For Tolstoy the religious 
consciousness is the higher comprehension of the meaning of life, 
and this, according to him, is the universal union of men with 
God and with one another. </p>

<p>When Tolstoy applies his criterion to the judgment of particular 
works of art, he is able to deduce striking results: “Christian 
Art, that is, the Art of our time, must be catholic in the direct 
sense of that word—that is, universal—and so must unite all men. 
There are but two kinds of sensations which unite all men—the 
sensations which arise from the recognition of man’s filial relation 
to God and of the brotherhood of men, and the simplest vital 
sensations which are accessible to all men without exception, 
such as the sensations of joy, meekness of spirit, alacrity, 
calm, etc. It is only these two kinds of sensations that form 
the subject of the Art of our time, which is good according to 
its contents.” Tolstoy in fact denied the value of all human 
endeavours except those which tend <i>directly</i> to the union 
of men. It may be suspected that his religious enthusiasm was 
due to his belief that Religion had this tendency. He distinguished, 
it will be remembered, very sharply between Religion and religions; 
a distinction with which many besides Tolstoy have consoled themselves. 
But his essential aim, his single value, was the union of men. 
All other things are of value only in so far as they tend to 
promote this, and art shares the general subordination. Even 
a joke, for Tolstoy, is only a joke so long as all men may share 
in it, a truly revolutionary amendment. The sharing is more important 
than the merriment. On these principles he surveys European Art 
and Literature. With magnificent defiance of accepted values, 
and the hardness of heart of a supreme doctrinaire, one after 
another of the unassailables is toppled from its eminence. Shakespeare, 
Dante, Goethe, etc., are rejected; Wagner in especial is the 
object of a critical <i>tour de force</i>. In their place are 
set <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, <i>The Chimes</i>, <i>Adam Bede</i>, 
<i>Les Miserables</i> (almost the only thing in French literature 
of which Tolstoy could approve), and <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>.<a id="note9.2text"></a><a href="#note9.2">†</a> 
All art which does not directly urge the union of men, or whose 
appeal is suspected to be limited to cultured and aristocratic 
circles, is condemned. “All who are not hand in hand with me 
are against me,” thought Tolstoy, under the urgency of his sense 
of human misery. Any diversion of art from a single narrow channel 
seemed to him an irreparable waste. Remembering no doubt how 
deeply he had been affected and influenced in the past by the 
things which he now deplored, he came in the end to assign unlimited 
powers to art when rightly directed. But, if we think of the 
other things which he also invoked to the same end, there is 
a ring of despair in his final cry: “Art must remove violence, 
only Art can do this.” </p>

<p>We may compare with this a famous utterance of another aristocrat, 
equally a supreme artist, equally in rebellion against the whole 
fabric of conventional civilisation, whose “passion for reforming 
the world” was not less than Tolstoy’s, but who differed from 
him in the possession of a wider and more complete sense of values 
and a mind not riven and distorted by a late conversion. </p>

<p>“The whole objection of the immorality of poetry rests upon a 
misconception of the manner in which poetry acts to produce the 
moral improvement of man. Ethical science arranges the elements 
which poetry has created, and propounds schemes and proposes 
examples of civil and domestic life: nor is it for want of admirable 
doctrines that men hate, and despise, and censure, and deceive 
and subjugate one another. </p>

<p>“But poetry acts in a diviner manner. It awakens and enlarges 
the mind itself by rendering it the receptacle of a thousand 
unapprehended combinations of thought. Whatever strengthens and 
purifies the affections, enlarges the imagination, and adds spirit 
to sense, is useful. It exceeds all imagination to conceive what 
would have been the moral condition of the world if neither Dante, 
Petrarch, Boccaccio, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Calderon, Lord Bacon, 
nor Milton, had ever existed.” </p>

<p>It is curious how the insertion of particular names here seems 
to weaken the argument. The world, we feel fairly certain, would 
be on the whole much the same even if there had been no Boccaccio 
and no Lord Bacon. Things would not be very different, some people 
will think, even if none of these authors had ever bestirred 
themselves to write. Shakespeare, as so often, would perhaps 
be counted an exception. But this sense that there are, after 
all, very few poets who individually make much difference is 
not in the least an objection to Shelley’s main thesis. We could 
bale a vast amount of water out of the sea without making any 
apparent difference to it, but this would not prove that it does 
not consist of water. Even if the removal of the influence of 
all the poets whose names we know made no appreciable difference 
in human affairs, it would still be true that the enlargement 
of the mind, the widening of the sphere of human sensibility, 
is brought about through poetry. </p>

<br>

<p>A too narrow view of values, or a too simple conception of morality 
is usually the cause of these misunderstandings of the arts. 
The agelong controversy as to whether the business of poetry 
is to please or to instruct shows this well. “Poets wish either 
to instruct or to delight or to combine solid and useful with 
the agreeable.” “It is only for the purpose of being useful that 
Poetry ought to be agreeable; pleasure is only a means which 
she uses for the end of profit.” So thought Boileau and Rapin. 
Dryden, modest and penetrating in his fashion, was “satisfied 
if it cause delight: for delight is the chief, if not the only, 
end of poetry: instruction can be admitted but in the second 
place; for poesy only instructs as it delights.” But he does 
not further specify the nature of the delight or the instruction, 
an omission in which most critics except Shelley agree. Our view 
on the point entirely depends upon this. If we set the sugarcoated-pill 
view aside as beneath serious consideration, there still remains 
a problem. A reviewer of the recent performance of the <i>Cenci</i> 
will state it excellently for us. </p>

<p>“It had been better had Shelley’s <i>Cenci</i> remained for ever 
banned. It represents three hours of unrelieved, agonising misery. 
. . . What excuse is there for the depicting of horrors such 
as these? There must be some, for a house packed with literary 
celebrities fiercely applauded. If the function of the theatre 
is to amuse, then in the presentation of the <i>Cenci</i> it 
has missed its aim. If it is to instruct, what moral can be pointed 
for the better conduct of our lives by a tragedy such as this? 
If Art be the answer, then Art may well be sacrificed.” </p>

<p>No doubt the literary celebrities, with their applause, were 
to blame, in part, for this. Our relic of the Age of Good Sense 
made a just reaction. He accurately registered the effect to 
which bad acting and inept production<a id="note9.3text"></a><a href="#note9.3">*</a> gave rise. But it is 
with his argument not with his reaction that we are concerned. 
The celebrities, if they had not been too busy giving vent (though 
in a mistaken form) to their loyalty to the memory of Shelley, 
and to their sense of triumph over the Censor, might have told 
him that neither amusement nor instruction is what the judicious 
seek from Tragedy, and referred him to Aristotle. Neither term, 
unless we wrench it right out of its usual setting, is appropriate 
to the greater forms of art. The experiences which they occasion 
are too full, too varied, too whole, too subtly balanced upon 
opposing impulses, whether of pity and terror or of joy and despair, 
to be so easily described. Tragedy— </p>

<div class="poetry"><p style="font-size: 0.9em; text-indent:0em; margin-top:1em; padding-left:10%; text-indent:15%; margin-bottom:1em">beneath whose sable roof <br>

May meet at noontide; Fear and Trembling Hope, <br>
Silence and Foresight, Death the Skeleton <br>
And Time the Shadow, </p></div>

<p class="noindent">is still the form under which the mind may most clearly and freely 
contemplate the human situation, its issues unclouded, its possibilities 
revealed. To this its value is due and the supreme position among 
the arts which it has occupied in historical times and still 
occupies; what will happen in the future we can only conjecture. 
Tragedy is too great an exercise of the spirit to be classed 
among amusements or even delights, or to be regarded as a vehicle 
for the inculcation of such crude valuations as may be codified 
in a moral. But the fuller discussion of Tragedy we must defer. </p>

<p>These remarks seemed necessary in order to avoid the impression, 
which our theory of value might have given, that the arts are 
merely concerned with happy solutions and ingenious reconciliations 
of diverse gratifications, “a box where sweets compacted lie.” 
It is not so. Only a crude psychology, as we shall see, would 
identify the satisfaction of an impulse with a pleasure. No hedonic 
theory of value will fit the facts over even a small part of 
the field, since it must take what is a concomitant merely of 
a phase in the process of satisfaction as the mainspring of the 
whole. Pleasure, however, has its place in the whole account 
of values, and an important place, as we shall see later. But 
it must not be allowed to encroach on ground to which it has 
no right. </p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Another</span> possible misapprehension which cannot be left unmentioned 
arises in connection with the doctrine ‘Art for Art’s sake’, 
a doctrine definitely and detrimentally dated; it concerns the 
place of what are called ulterior effects in the valuing of a 
work of art. It has been very fashionable to turn up the nose 
at any attempt to apply, as it is said, ‘external canons’ to 
art. But it may be recalled that of all the great critical doctrines, 
the ‘moral’, theory of art (it would be better to call it the 
‘Ordinary values’ theory) has the most great minds behind it. 
Until Whistler came to start the critical movements of the last 
half-century, few poets, artists or critics had ever doubted 
that the value of art experiences was to be judged as other values 
are. Plato, Aristotle, Horace, Dante, Spenser, Milton, the Eighteenth 
Century, Coleridge, Shelley, Matthew Arnold and Pater, to name 
only the most prominent, all with varying degrees of refinement, 
held the same view.<a id="note10.1text"></a><a href="#note10.1">*</a> The last is a somewhat unexpected adherent. </p>

<p>“Given the conditions I have tried to explain as constituting 
good art, then if it be devoted further to the increase of men’s 
happiness, to the redemption of the oppressed, or to the enlargement 
of our sympathies with each other, or to such presentment of 
new and old truth about ourselves and our relation to the world 
as may fortify us in our sojourn here . . . it will also be great 
art; if, over and above those qualities which I have summed up
. . . it has something of the soul of humanity in it, and finds 
its logical, its architectural place, in the great structure 
of human life.”<a id="note10.2text"></a><a href="#note10.2">†</a> No better brief emotive account of the conditions 
under which an experience has value could be desired. </p>

<p>Against all these weighty opinions, the view—supported largely 
by a distinction between Form and Content, Subject and Handling, 
which will be examined elsewhere,<a id="note10.3text"></a><a href="#note10.3">*</a> and relying upon the doctrine 
of intrinsic, supersensible, ultimate Goods discussed above—that 
the values of art are unique, or capable of being considered 
in isolation from all others, has held sway for some thirty years 
in many most reputable quarters. The reasons for this attempted 
severance have already been touched upon; they are of all sorts. 
Partly it may be due to the influence of Whistler and Pater, 
and of those still more influential disciples who spread their 
doctrines. Partly it may be due to a massed reaction against 
Ruskin. Partly again we may suspect the influence, rather suddenly 
encountered, of Continental and German æsthetics upon the English 
mind. Almost from the beginning of scientific æsthetics, the 
insistence on the æsthetic experience as an experience, peculiar, 
complete, and capable of being studied in isolation, has received 
prominence. Often it is no more than an extension into this considering, 
whenever possible, one thing at a time. When critics in England, 
not very long ago, heard that there was something connected with 
art and poetry—namely, the æsthetic experience—which could be 
considered and examined in isolation by the methods of introspection, 
they not unnaturally leapt to the conclusion that its value also 
could be isolated and described without reference to other things. 
In some hands the further conclusions drawn were too queer to 
outlive their hour of fashion. They amounted often to the postulation 
of a ‘specific thrill’ yielded by works of art and nothing else, 
unlike and unconnected with all other experiences. “No queerer,” 
it was said, “than anything else in this incredibly queer universe.”<a id="note10.4text"></a><a href="#note10.4">†</a> 
But the queerness of the universe is of a different and a more 
interesting sort. It may be a curiosity shop but it nowhere seems 
to be a chaos. </p>

<p>For our present purposes we need only consider the view as it 
is put forward by its ablest exponent, a critic who by his own 
explanations of this formula goes very far towards meeting the 
objection we urge. </p>

<p>“What then does the formula ‘Poetry for Poetry’s sake’ tell us 
about this experience? It says, as I understand it, these things. 
First, this experience is an end in itself, is worth having on 
ifs own account, has an intrinsic value. Next, its <i>poetic</i> 
value is this intrinsic worth alone. Poetry may have also have 
an ulterior value as a means to culture or religion; because 
it conveys instruction or softens the passions, or furthers a 
good cause; because it brings the poet fame, or money, or a quiet 
conscience. So much the better: let it be valued for these reasons 
too. But its ulterior worth neither is nor can directly determine 
its poetic worth as a satisfying imaginative experience; and 
this is to be judged entirely from within. . . . The consideration 
of ulterior ends whether by the poet in the act of composing 
or by the reader in the act of experiencing, tends to lower poetic 
value. It does so because it tends to change the nature of poetry 
by taking it out of its own atmosphere. For its nature is to 
be not a part, nor yet a copy of the real world (as we commonly 
understand that phrase) but to be a world by itself, independent, 
complete, autonomous<a id="note10.5text"></a><a href="#note10.5">†</a>.” </p>

<p>There seem four points well worth close consideration here. The 
first is that the things mentioned as possible ulterior values 
in Dr Bradley’s list—culture, religion, instruction, softening 
of the passions, furtherance of good causes, the poet’s fame, 
or money, or quiet conscience—these things are plainly upon quite 
different levels. He says of all of them that they cannot possibly 
determine the poetic worth of an æsthetic experience; that whether 
or no any poetic experience is poetically valuable cannot depend 
upon any of these ulterior values. But it is certain that some 
of these stand in a quite different relation to the poetic experience 
than do others. Culture, religion, instruction in some special 
senses, softening of the passions, and the furtherance of good 
causes may be directly concerned in our judgments of the <i>poetic</i> 
values of experiences. Otherwise, as we shall see, the word ‘poetic’ 
becomes a useless sound. On the other hand, the poet’s fame, 
his reward, or his conscience, seem plainly to be irrelevant. 
That is the first point. </p>

<p>The second point is that what Dr Bradley says as to the imaginative 
experience—that it is to be judged entirely from within—is misleading. 
In most cases we do not judge it from within. Our judgment as 
to its value is no part of it. In rare instances such a judgment 
may be part of it, but this is exceptional. As a rule we have 
to come out of it in order to judge it, and we judge it by memory 
or by other residual effects which we learn to be good indices 
to its value. If by judging it in the experience we mean merely 
while these residual effects are fresh, we may agree. In so judging 
it, however, it’s “place in the great structure of human life” 
cannot possibly be ignored. The value which it has is dependent 
upon this, and we cannot judge that value without taking this 
place, and with it innumerable ulterior worths, into account. 
It is not that we shall evaluate it wrongly if we neglect them, 
but that evaluation is just this taking account of everything, 
and of the way things hang together. </p>

<p>The third point arises with regard to Dr Bradley’s third position, 
that the consideration of ulterior ends, whether by the poet 
in the act of composing, or by the reader in the act of experiencing, 
tends to lower poetic value. Here all depends upon <i>which are 
the ulterior ends in question</i>, and what the kind of poetry. 
It will not be denied that for some kinds of poetry the <i>intrusion</i> 
of certain ulterior ends may, and often does, lower their value; 
but there seem plainly to be other kinds of poetry in which its 
value as poetry definitely and directly depends upon the ulterior 
ends involved. Consider the Psalms, Isaiah, the New Testament, 
Dante, the <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>, Rabelais, any really universal 
satire, Swift, Voltaire, Byron. </p>

<p>In all these cases the consideration of ulterior ends has been 
certainly essential to the act of composing. That needs no arguing; 
but, equally, this consideration of the ulterior ends involved 
is inevitable to the reader. </p>

<p>Dr Bradley puts this third position forward in a tentative form; 
he says that the ulterior <i>tends</i> to lower poetic value, 
an important reservation, but it would be better to distinguish 
two kinds of poetry, one to which his doctrine applies and one 
to which it does not. As illustrations of the cases in which 
his doctrine does apply, <i>The Ancient Mariner</i> and <i>Hartleap 
Well</i> may be mentioned. Here in both cases the experiences 
are of a kind into which no ulterior ends enter in any important 
degree. Thus when Coleridge and Wordsworth introduce moral considerations, 
the effect is undeniably one of intrusion. As Mrs Meynell comically 
remarks, “<i>The Ancient Mariner</i> offends upon a deliberate 
plan. It denies the natural function of observation when it invents 
sanctions for the protection of a wild bird’s life, and for the 
punishment of its slaughter. Coleridge intends to enforce a lesson 
by telling us that 200 mariners died of thirst because they had—with 
the superstition pardonable in their state of education—supposed 
an albatross to be the bringer of foggy weather, and had approved 
its slaughter, as almost all men implicitly approve the daily 
slaughter of innocent beast and bird.” But this charge against 
Coleridge is only reasonable if we make of this ulterior end, 
this ‘lesson’ against cruelty to animals, a vital part of the 
poem. Mrs Meynell, we may think, takes Coleridge’s moral too 
seriously. It may be this possibility which Coleridge had in 
mind when he said, long afterwards, that <i>The Ancient Mariner</i> 
did not contain enough of the moral. As the poem stands, it is 
of a kind into which ulterior ends do not enter. If we are to 
take this alien element, this lesson, into account in our judgment, 
we shall have deliberately to misread the poem, with Mrs Meynell. 
The same considerations apply to <i>Hartleap Well</i>; and so 
far as Dr Bradley is merely enforcing this point, we may agree; 
but he fails to notice—it is only fair to say that few critics 
seem ever to notice it—that poetry is of more than one kind, 
and that the different kinds are to be judged by different principles. 
There is a kind of poetry into the judgment of which ulterior 
ends directly and essentially enter; a kind part of whose value 
is directly derivable from the value of the ends with which it 
is associated. There are other kinds, into which ulterior ends 
do not enter in any degree, and there are yet other kinds whose 
value may be lowered by the intrusion of ends relatively trivial 
in value. Dr Bradley is misled by the usual delusion that there 
is in this respect only one kind of poetry, into saying far more 
than the facts of poetic experience will justify. </p>

<p>The fourth point is of more general importance perhaps than these 
three. It is in fact the real point of disagreement between the 
view we are upholding and the doctrine which Dr Bradley, together 
with the vast majority of modern critics, wishes to maintain. 
It is stated in the concluding sentence of the paragraph which 
I have quoted. He says of poetry that “its nature is to be, not 
a part nor yet a copy of the real world, as we commonly understand 
that phrase, but to be a world by itself, independent, complete, 
autonomous. To possess it fully, you must enter that world, conform 
to its laws, and ignore, for the time being, the beliefs, aims, 
and particular conditions which belong to you in the other world 
of reality.” This doctrine insists: upon a severance between 
poetry and what, in opposition, may be called life; a complete 
severance, allowing however, as Dr Bradley goes on to insist—an 
‘underground’ connection. But this ‘underground’ connection is 
all-important. Whatever there is in the poetic experience has 
come through it. The world of poetry has in no sense any different 
reality from the rest of the world and it has no special laws 
and no other-worldly peculiarities. It is made up of experiences 
of exactly the same kinds as those that come to us in other ways. 
Every poem however is a strictly limited piece of experience, 
a piece which breaks up more or less easily if alien elements 
intrude. It is more highly and more delicately organised than 
ordinary experiences of the street or of the hillside; it is 
fragile. Further it is communicable. It may be experienced by 
many different minds with only slight variations. That this should 
be possible is one of the conditions of its organisation. It 
differs from many other experiences, whose value is very similar, 
in this very communicability. For these reasons when we experience 
it, or attempt to, we must preserve it from contamination, from 
the irruptions of personal particularities. We must keep the 
poem undisturbed by these or we fail to read it and have some 
other experience instead. For these reasons we establish a severance, 
we draw a boundary between the poem and what is not the poem 
in our experience. But this is no severance between unlike things 
but between different systems of the same activities. The gulf 
between them is no greater than that between the impulses which 
direct the pen and those which conduct the pipe of a man who 
is smoking and writing at once, and the ‘disassociation’ or severance 
of the poetic experience is merely a freeing of it from extraneous 
ingredients and influences. The myth of a ‘transmutation’ or 
‘poetisation’ of experience and that other myth of the ‘contemplative’ 
or ‘æsthetic’ attitude, are in part due to talking about Poetry 
and the ‘poetic’ instead of thinking about the concrete experiences 
which are poems. </p>

<p>The separation of poetic experience from its place in life and 
its ulterior worths, involves a definite lop-sidedness, narrowness, 
and incompleteness in those who preach it sincerely. No one, 
of course, would bring such charges against the author of <i>Shakespearean 
Tragedy</i>; his is that welcome and not unfamiliar case of the 
critic whose practice is a refutation of his principles. When 
genuinely held the view leads to an attempted splitting up of 
the experiencing reader into a number of distinct faculties or 
departments which have no real existence. It is impossible to 
divide a reader into so many men—an æsthetic man, a moral man, 
a practical man, a political man, an intellectual man, and so 
on. It cannot be done. In any genuine experience all these elements 
inevitably enter. But if it could be done, as many critics pretend, 
the result would be fatal to the wholeness and sanction of the 
critical judgment. We cannot e.g. read Shelley adequately while 
believing that all his views are moonshine—read <i>Prometheus 
Unbound</i> while holding that ‘the perfectibility of man is 
an undesirable ideal’ and that ‘hangmen are excellent things.’ 
To say that there is a purely æsthetic or poetic approach to, 
let us say, the <i>Sermon on the Mount</i>, by which no consideration 
of the intention or ulterior end of the poem enters, would appear 
to be merely mental timidity, the shrinking remark of a person 
who finds essential literature too much for him. Into an adequate 
reading of the greater kinds of poetry everything not private 
and peculiar to the individual reader must come in. The reader 
must be required to wear no blinkers, to overlook nothing which 
is relevant, to shut off no part of himself from participation. 
If he attempts to assume the peculiar attitude of disregarding 
all but some hypothetically-named æsthetic elements, he joins 
Henry James’ Osmond in his tower, he joins Blake’s Kings and 
Priests in their High Castles and Spires. </p>

<span class="smcap">A Sketch for a Psychology</span></h2>
<div class ="epigraph">
<p style="text-align: center; text-indent:0em">“Wot’s wot?” repeated one of the buccaneers in a deep growl. “Ah, <br>
he’d be a lucky one as knowed that!”—<i>Treasure Island</i>. </p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">M. Jules Romains</span> recently observed<a id="note11.1text"></a><a href="#note11.1">†</a> that psychology hitherto 
has merely contrived to say laboriously and obscurely, and with 
less precision, what we all know without its aid already. This 
is regrettably difficult to deny; any particular remark of a 
psychologist, if true, is unlikely to be startling. But at certain 
points new light has none the less crept in. Incoherences and 
flaws have been found in the common-sense picture, adumbration 
rather, of the mind; connections between bits of our behaviour, 
 which common-sense had missed, have been noted; and, still more 
important, a general outline of the kind of thing a mind is has 
begun to take shape. The next age but two, if an oncoming Age 
of Relativity is to be followed as Mr Haldane supposes<a id="note11.2text"></a><a href="#note11.2">†</a> by 
an Age of Biology, will be introduced by a recognition on the 
part of many minds of their own nature, a recognition which is 
certain to change their behaviour and their outlook considerably. 
We are still far removed from such an age. None the less enough 
is known for an analysis of the mental events which make up the 
reading of a poem to be attempted. And such an analysis is a 
primary necessity for criticism. The psychological distinctions 
which have hitherto served the critic are too few and his use 
of them in most cases too unsystematic, too vague, and too uncertain, 
for his insight to yield its full advantages. </p>

<p>The view put forward here is in many respects heterodox, a disadvantage 
in a sketch. But so many difficulties attend any exposition of 
psychology, however orthodox and however full, that the dangers 
of misunderstanding are outweighed by the advantages of a fresh 
point of view. It is the general outline and in particular the 
insistence upon an account of knowledge in terms merely of the 
causation of our thoughts which is contrary to received opinion. 
The detail of the analysis of poetic experience, the account 
of imagery, of emotion, of pleasure, of incipient action and 
so forth, although, so far as I am aware, no similar analysis 
has before been explicitly set out, may be taken as comparatively 
orthodox. </p>

<p>For our immediate purpose, for a clearer understanding of values 
and for the avoidance of unnecessary confusions in criticism, 
it is necessary to break away from the set of ideas by which 
popular and academic psychology alike attempt to describe the 
mind. We naturally tend to conceive it as a thing of a peculiar 
spiritual kind, fairly: persistent though variable, endowed with 
attributes, three in number, its capacities namely for knowing, 
willing and feeling, three irreducible modes of being aware of 
or concerned with objects. A violent shock to this entity comes 
when we are forced by a closer examination of the facts to conceive 
it as doing all these three unconsciously as well as consciously. 
An unconscious mind is a fairly evident fiction, useful though 
it may be, and goings on in the nervous system are readily accepted 
as a satisfactory substitute. From this to the recognition of 
the conscious mind as a similar fiction is no great step, although 
one which many people find difficult. Some of this difficulty 
is due to habit. It wears off as we notice how many of the things 
which we believed true of the fiction can be stated in terms 
of the less fictitious substitute. But much of the difficulty 
is emotive, non-intellectual, more specifically religious, in 
origin.<a id="note11.3text"></a><a href="#note11.3">*</a> It is due to desire, to fear, or to exaltation as 
the case may be, to emotion masquerading as thought, and is a 
difficulty not so easily removed. </p>

<p>That the mind is the nervous system, or rather a part of its 
activity, has long been evident, although the prevalence among 
psychologists of persons with philosophic antecedents has delayed 
the recognition of the fact in an extraordinary fashion. With 
every advance of neurology—and a decided advance here was perhaps 
the only good legacy left by the War<a id="note11.4text"></a><a href="#note11.4">†</a>—the evidence becomes 
more overwhelming. It is true that as our knowledge of the nervous 
system stands at present much of the detail of the identification 
is impenetrably obscure, and the account which we give must frankly 
be admitted to be only a degree less fictitious than one in terms 
of spiritual happenings. But the kind of account which is likely 
to be substantiated by future research has become clear, largely 
through the work of Behaviourists and Psycho-analysts, the assumptions 
and results of both needing to be corrected however in ways which 
the recent experimental and theoretical investigations of the 
‘<i>Gestalt</i>’ School are indicating. </p>

<p>The view that we are our bodies, more especially our nervous 
systems, more especially still the higher or more central co-ordinating 
parts of it, and that the mind is a system of impulses should 
not be described as Materialism. It might equally well be called 
Idealism. Neither term in this connection has any scientific, 
any strictly symbolic meaning or reference. Neither stands for 
any separable, observable group of things, or character in things. 
Each is primarily an emotive term used to incite or support certain 
emotional attitudes. Like all terms used in the vain attempt 
(vain because the question is nonsensical) to say what things 
are, instead of to say how they behave, they state nothing. Like 
all such terms they change in different hands from banners to 
bludgeons, being each for some people an emotive agent round 
which attitudes, aspirations, values are rallied, and for other 
people a weapon of offence by which persons supposed adverse 
to these attitudes, aspirations and values may, it is hoped, 
be discomfited. That the Materialist and the Idealist believe 
themselves to be holding views which are incompatible with one 
another is but an instance of a very widespread confusion between 
scientific statement and emotive appeal, with which we shall 
in later chapters be much concerned. The Mind-Body problem is 
strictly speaking no problem; it is an <i>imbroglio</i> due to 
failure to settle a real problem, namely, as to when we are making 
a statement and when merely inciting an attitude. A problem simpler 
here than in many cases, since the alleged statement is of an 
impossible form<a id="note11.5text"></a><a href="#note11.5">*</a>, but complicated on both sides of the controversy 
by misunderstanding of the attitudes which the other side is 
concerned to maintain. For if mental events are recognised as 
identical with certain neural events, neither the attitudes which 
ensue towards them nor the attitudes they themselves will warrantably 
take up, are changed so much as either Idealists or Materialists 
have commonly supposed. To call anything mental or spiritual, 
as opposed to material, or to call anything material as opposed 
to mental, is only to point out a difference between the two 
kinds. The differences which can actually be detected between 
a mental event, such as a toothache, and a non-mental event, 
such as a sunspot, remain when we have identified the mental 
event with a neural change. So recognised, it loses none of its 
observable peculiarities, only certain alleged unstatable and 
ineffable attributes are removed. It remains unlike any event 
which is not mental; it is as unparalleled as before. It retains 
its privileges as the most interesting of all events, and our 
relations to one another and to the world remain essentially 
as they were before the recognition. The extreme ecstasies of 
the mystic, like the attitudes of the engineer towards a successful 
contrivance, remain just as much and just as little appropriate 
with regard to the humblest or the proudest of our acts. Thus 
the identification of the mind with a part of the working of 
the nervous system, need involve, theology apart, no disturbance 
of anyone’s attitude to the world, his fellow-men, or to himself. 
Theology, however, is still more implicit in current attitudes 
than traditional sceptics suspect. </p>

<br>

<p>The nervous system is the means by which stimuli from the environment, 
or from within the body, result in appropriate behaviour. All 
mental events occur in the course of processes of adaptation, 
somewhere between a stimulus and a response. Thus every mental 
event has an origin in stimulation, a character, and consequences, 
in action or adjustment for action. Its character is sometimes 
accessible to introspection. What it feels like, in those cases 
in which it feels or is felt at all, is consciousness, but in 
many cases nothing is felt, the mental event is unconscious. 
Why some events are conscious but not others is at present a 
mystery; no one has yet succeeded in bringing the various hints 
which neurology may offer into connection with one another. In 
some important respects conscious and unconscious mental events 
must differ, but what these are no one can as yet safely conjecture. 
On the other hand there are many respects in which they are similar, 
and these are the respects which are at present most open to 
investigation. </p>

<p>The process in the course of which a mental event may occur, 
a process apparently beginning in a stimulus and ending in an 
act, is what we have called an impulse. In actual experience 
single impulses of course never occur. Even the simplest human 
reflexes are very intricate bundles of mutually dependent impulses, 
and in any actual human behaviour the number of simultaneous 
and connected impulses occurring is beyond estimation. The simple 
impulse in fact is a limit, and the only impulses psychology 
is concerned with are complex. It is often convenient to speak 
as though simple impulses were in question, as when we speak 
of an impulse of hunger, or an impulse to laugh, but we must 
not forget how intricate all our activities are. </p>

<p>To take the stimulus as a starting-point is in some ways misleading. 
Of the possible stimuli which we might at any moment receive, 
only a few actually take effect. Which are received and which 
impulses ensue depends upon which of our interests is active, 
upon the general set, that is, of our activities. This is conditioned 
in a large degree by the state, of satisfaction or unrest, of 
the recurrent and persistent needs of the body. When hungry and 
when replete we respond differently to the stimulus of a smell 
of cooking. A change in the wind unnoticed by the passengers 
causes the captain to reduce sail. Social needs in this respect 
are often as important as individual. Thus some people walking 
in a Gallery with friends before whom they wish to shine will 
actually receive far more stimulus from the pictures than they 
would if by themselves. </p>

<p>A stimulus then must not be conceived as an alien intruder which 
thrusts itself upon us and, after worming a devious way through 
our organism as through a piece of cheese, emerges at the other 
end as an act. Stimuli are only received if they serve some need 
of the organism and the form which the response to them takes 
depends only in part upon the nature of the stimulus, and much 
more upon what the organism ‘wants’, i.e. the state of equilibrium 
of its multifarious activities. </p>

<p>Thus experience has two sources which in different cases have 
very different importance. So far as we are thinking about or 
referring to certain definite things our behaviour in all probability 
will only be appropriate (i.e. our thoughts true) in so far as 
it is determined by the nature of the present and past stimuli 
we have received from those things and things like them. So far 
as we are satisfying our needs and desires a much less strict 
connection between stimulus and response is sufficient. A baby 
howls at first in much the same way, whatever the cause of his 
unrest, and older persons behave not unlike him. Any occasion 
may be sufficient for taking exercise, or for a quarrel, for 
falling in love or having a drink. To this partial independence 
of behaviour (from stimulus) is due the sometimes distressing 
fact that views, opinions and beliefs vary so much with our differing 
moods. Such variation shows that the view, belief or opinion 
is not a purely intellectual product, is not due to thinking 
in the narrower sense, of response that is governed by stimuli, 
present or past, but is an attitude adopted to satisfy some desire, 
temporary or lasting. Thought in the strictest sense varies only 
with evidence: but attitudes and feelings change for all manner 
of reasons. </p>

<p>The threefold division between the causes, character and consequences 
of a mental event, conscious or unconscious, corresponds, with 
certain qualifications, to the usual division in traditional 
psychology of thought (or cognition), feeling, and will (or conation). 
To be cognisant of anything, to know it, is to be influenced 
by it; to desire, to seek, to will anything is to act towards 
it. In between these two are the conscious accompaniments, if 
any, of the whole process. These last, the conscious characters 
of the mental event, include evidently both sensations and feelings. 
(Cf. Chapter XVL, pp. 125-128.) </p>

<p>The correspondence is not by any means simple. Many things are 
included under knowing, for example, which on this reconstruction 
of psychology would have to be counted as willing.<a id="note11.6text"></a><a href="#note11.6">*</a> Expectation, 
usually described as a cognitive attitude, becomes a peculiar 
form of action, getting ready, namely, to receive certain kinds 
of stimuli rather than others. The opposite case is equally common. 
Hunger, a typical desire on the usual account, would become knowledge, 
giving us, when genuine hunger, obscure awareness of a lack of 
nourishment, when habit-hunger, awareness of a certain phase 
in a cyclic visceral process. These illustrations bring out clearly 
what is everywhere recognised, that the customary cognition-feeling-conation 
classification of mental goings on is not a pigeon-holing of 
exclusive processes. Every mental event has, in varying degrees, 
all three characteristics. Thus expectation as a preparation 
for certain stimuli may lower the threshold for them, and sometimes 
makes their reception more and sometimes less discriminating; 
hunger also is characteristically accompanied by a search for 
food. </p>

<p>The advantage of substituting the causation, the character and 
the consequences of a mental event as its fundamental aspects 
in place of its knowing, feeling, and willing aspects is that 
instead of a trio of incomprehensible ultimates we have a set 
of aspects which not only mental events but all events share. 
We have, of course, to introduce qualifications. Stimuli, as 
we have mentioned above, are not the only causes of mental events. 
The nervous system is specialised to receive impressions through 
the organs of sense, but its state at any moment is also determined 
by a host of other factors. The condition of the blood and the 
position of the head are typical instances. Only that part of 
the cause of a mental event which takes effect through incoming 
(sensory) impulses or through effects of past sensory impulses 
can be said to be thereby known. The reservation no doubt involves 
complications. But any plausible account of what knowledge is 
and how it happens is bound to be complicated. </p>

<p>Similarly, not all the effects of a mental event are to be counted 
as what that event wills or seeks after; apoplectic strokes, 
for example, can be ruled out. Only those movements which the 
nervous system is specialised to incite, which take place through 
motor impulses, should be included. </p>

<p>On all other accounts the relation between an awareness and what 
it is aware of is a mystery. We can name the relation as we please, 
apprehension, presentation, cognition or knowledge, but there 
we have to leave the matter. On this account we make use of the 
fact that an awareness, say of a variety of black marks on this 
page, is caused in a certain peculiar way, namely through impressions 
on a part of the brain (the retina) and various complicated connected 
goings on in other parts of the brain. To say that the mental 
(neural) event so caused is aware of the black marks is to say 
that it is caused by them, and here ‘aware of’ = ‘caused by’. 
The two statements are merely alternative formulations. </p>

<p>In extending this account to more complicated situations where 
we know or, less ambiguously, <i>refer to</i> things which are 
past or future we have to make use of the fact that impressions 
are commonly <i>signs</i>, have effects which depend not on themselves 
alone but upon the other impressions which have co-operated with 
them in the past. </p>

<p>A sign<a id="note11.7text"></a><a href="#note11.7">*</a> is something which has once been a member of a context 
or configuration that worked in the mind as a whole. When it 
reappears its effects are as though the rest of the context were 
present. In analysing complex events of referring we have to 
break them up artificially into the simpler sign-situations out 
of which they arise; not forgetting meanwhile how interdependent 
the parts of any interpretation of a complex sign are. </p>

<p>The detail of this procedure is most easily studied in connection 
with the use of words. We shall deal with it therefore in Chapter 
XVI, where the reading of a poem is discussed. Here only the 
general principle matters that to know anything is to be influenced 
by it, directly when we sense it, indirectly when the effects 
of past conjunctions of impressions come into play. More will 
be added later, in connection with the process of reading, about 
the receptive, the knowledge aspect of mental events. The other 
two aspects need less explanation. They are also more generally 
important for the understanding of poetic, musical and other 
experiences. For a theory of knowledge is needed only at one 
point, the point at which we wish to decide whether a poem, for 
example, is true, or reveals reality, and if so in what sense; 
admittedly a very important question. Whereas a theory of feeling, 
of emotion, of attitudes and desires, of the affective-volitional 
aspect of mental activity, is required at all points of our analysis. </p>

<p style="text-align: center; text-indent:0em">The poor benefit of a bewitching minute.—<i>The Revenger’s Tragedy</i>. </p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Sensation</span>, imagery, feeling, emotion, together with pleasure, 
unpleasure and pain are names for the conscious characteristics 
of impulses: How they may best be sorted out is a problem whose 
difficulty is much aggravated by the shortcomings of language 
at this point. We speak, for instance, of pleasures and pains 
in the same fashion, as though they were of the same order, but, 
strictly, although pains as single self-sufficing modifications 
of consciousness are easily enough obtainable, pleasures by themselves 
do not seem to occur. Pleasure seems to be a way in which something 
happens, rather than an independent happening which can occur 
by itself in a mind. We have, not pleasures, but experiences 
of one kind or another, visual, auditory, organic, motor, and 
so forth, which are pleasant. Similarly we have experiences which 
are unpleasant. If, however, we call them painful we give rise 
to an ambiguity. We may be saying that they are unpleasant or 
we may be saying that they are accompanied by pains, which is 
a different matter. The use of the term pleasure, as though like 
pain it was itself a complete experience, instead of being something 
which attaches to or follows along with or after other experiences, 
has led to a number of confusions; especially in those critical 
theses, to which objection has already been taken in Chapter 
IX, which identify value with pleasure. </p>

<p>The twenty or more distinct kinds of sensations, into which modern 
psychology has elaborated the old five senses, can be observed 
to differ very widely in the degree to which they are susceptible 
of and accompanied by pleasantness and unpleasantness. The higher 
senses, sight and hearing, in most persons seem to yield sensations 
which vary much less from neutrality or indifference than the 
others. We must be careful to understand this difference correctly 
however. An arrangement of colours and shapes, a sequence of 
notes or a musical phrase may, of course, in suitable people, 
be as intensely toned, pleasantly or unpleasantly, as any organic 
or taste sensations, for example. But even this is not usual. 
The right experiment is to compare a single colour, say, or a 
single note, with such a sensation as a uniform touch or temperature 
gives rise to, a bath for example, or with a simple uniform taste 
or smell, or with hunger, or nausea. Fair comparison is difficult, 
equivalent levels of simplicity and uniformity being impossible 
to discover, but few will doubt that the degree of pleasure-unpleasure 
aroused by tastes, for example, far exceeds that which auditory 
or visual sensations excite by themselves. We must of course 
be careful here to avoid confusing the intrinsic pleasure-unpleasure 
of the sensations with that which arises through memory, through 
the effects of other sensations, pleasant or unpleasant, which 
may have accompanied them in the past, and through expectations 
agreeable or disagreeable. </p>

<p>To speak of the intrinsic pleasure-unpleasure of a sensation 
is perhaps misleading. The pleasantness of a sensation as we 
know is a highly variable thing. It may alter completely while 
the strictly sensory characteristics of the sensation remain 
as before. The difference in the same smell of liquor, before 
and after an alcoholic excess is a striking example. A sound 
which is pleasant for a while may become very unpleasant if it 
continues and does not lapse from consciousness. And yet indisputably 
it may remain <i>qua</i> sensation the same. A sound-sensation 
may remain unchanged in tone, volume and intensity yet vary widely 
in pleasure-unpleasure. This difference is important. It is one 
of the chief reasons which have caused feeling (pleasure-unpleasure) 
to be distinguished from sensation as altogether of a different 
nature. Tone, volume and intensity are features in the sound 
closely dependent upon the stimulus, pleasantness is dependent 
not on external stimulus but upon factors, very obscure at present, 
in us. All here is conjecture. The close connection of stimulus 
with sensation we know because it happens to be comparatively 
accessible to experiment. And introspection of sensations of 
external origin is for that reason much more easy than introspection 
of most visceral or organic sensations. We can practise it freely 
and repeat it and so control our results. To a lesser extent 
those sensations of internal origin which we can in part consciously 
control, those due to voluntary movements, share this double 
accessibility. But all the rest of the multifarious conscious 
goings on in the nervous system remain obscure. One broad fact, 
however, is important. The effects in the body of almost all 
stimuli of whatever nature are extraordinarily numerous and varied. 
“You cannot show the observer a wall-paper pattern without by 
that very fact disturbing his respiration and circulation.”<a id="note12.1text"></a><a href="#note12.1">†</a> 
And no man knows what other disturbances do not join in. The 
whole body resounds in what would seem to be a fairly systematic 
way. Whether the outpouring of this tide of disturbance makes 
up a part of, gives a tone to consciousness, or whether only 
the incoming reports of the results can be conscious is a question 
upon which no conclusive evidence would seem to be yet available. 
The incoming reports of some at least of these disturbances certainly 
can become conscious. A lump in the throat, a yearning of the 
bowels, horripilation, breathlessness, these are their coarser 
and more obvious forms. Usually, they are less salient and fuse 
with the whole mass of internal sensations to form the <i>cœnesthesia</i>, 
the whole bodily consciousness, tinging it, altering its general 
character in some one of perhaps a thousand different ways. </p>

<p>It has been much disputed whether pleasure-unpleasure is a quality 
of general bodily or organic consciousness, of some part of it 
perhaps, or whether it is something quite different from any 
quality of any sensation or set of sensations. As we have seen, 
it is not a quality of an auditory sensation in the sense in 
which its loudness, for instance, is a quality. There seem to 
be similar objections to making it a quality of any sensation 
of any kind. A sensation is what an impulse at a certain stage 
in its development feels like, and its sensory qualities are 
characters<a id="note12.2text"></a><a href="#note12.2">*</a> of the impulse at that stage. The pleasure-unpleasure 
attaching to the impulse may be no character of the impulse itself, 
but of its fate, its success or failure in restoring equilibrium 
to the system to which it belongs. </p>

<p>This is perhaps as good a guess at what pleasure and unpleasure 
are as can yet be made, pleasure being successful activity of 
some kind, not necessarily of a biologically useful kind, and 
unpleasure being frustrated, chaotic, mal-successful activity. 
We shall consider this theory again at a later stage (cf. Chapter 
XXIV). The point to be made here is that pleasure and unpleasure 
are complicated matters arising in the course of activities which 
are directed to other ends. The old controversies as to whether 
pleasure is the goal of all striving or whether avoidance of 
unpleasure the starting-point, are thus escaped. As Ribot pointed 
out<a id="note12.3text"></a><a href="#note12.3">†</a> the exclusive quest of pleasure for itself, <i>plaisir-passion</i>, 
is a morbid form of activity and self-destructive. Pleasure on 
this view is originally an <i>effect</i> signifying that certain 
positive or negative tendencies have instinctively attained their 
aim and are satisfied. Later through experience it becomes a 
cause. Instructed by experience man and animal alike place themselves 
in circumstances which will arouse desire and so through satisfaction 
lead to pleasure. The gourmet, the libertine, the æsthete, the 
mystic do so alike. But when the pleasure which is the result 
of satisfying the tendency becomes the end pursued rather than 
the satisfying of the tendency itself, then an ‘<i>inversion</i> 
of the psychological mechanism’ comes about. In the one case 
the activity is propagated from below upwards, in the other from 
above downwards, from the brain to the organic functions. The 
result is often an exhaustion of the tendency, ‘disillusionment’ 
and the <i>blasé</i>, world-wearied attitude. </p>

<p>The evil results, as Ribot remarks, are largely confined to those 
individuals in whom the quest for pleasure has the force of an 
obsession. But on the view of pleasure which we have indicated 
above, it is clear that all those doctrines, very common in critical 
literature, which set up pleasure as the goal of activity, are 
mistaken. Every activity has its own specific goal. Pleasure 
very probably ensues in most cases when this goal is reached, 
but that is a different matter. To read a poem for the sake of 
the pleasure which will ensue if it is successfully read is to 
approach it in an inadequate attitude. Obviously it is the poem 
in which we should be interested, not in a by-product of having 
managed successfully to read it. The orientation of attention 
is wrong if we put the pleasure in the forefront. Such a mistake 
is perhaps not common among instructed persons, but to judge 
by many remarks which appear in reviews and dramatic notices 
the percentage of instructed persons among reviewers and theatre-goers 
does not seem high. This error, a legacy in part from the criticism 
of an age which had a still poorer psychological vocabulary<a id="note12.4text"></a><a href="#note12.4">*</a> 
than Our own, is one reason why Tragedy, for example, is so often 
misapproached. It is no less absurd to suppose that a competent 
reader sits down to read for the sake of pleasure, than to suppose 
that a mathematician sets out to solve an equation with a view 
to the pleasure its solution will afford him. The pleasure in 
both cases may, of course, be very great. But the pleasure, however 
great it may be, is no more the aim of the activity in the course 
of which it arises, than, for example, the noise made by a motor-cycle—useful 
though it is as an indication of the way the machine is running—is 
the reason in the normal case for its having been started. </p>

<p>This very common mistake noted, the significance of pleasure 
and unpleasure may be insisted upon without misgiving. They are 
our most delicate signs of how our activities are thriving. But 
since even the most intense delight may indicate only a local 
success and the activity be generally detrimental, they are signs 
which need a very wary interpretation. </p>

<p style="text-align:right; margin-right:10%"><i>The Broken Heart</i>. </p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> alluding to the cœnesthesia we came very near to giving an 
account of emotion as an ingredient of consciousness. Stimulating 
situations give rise to widespread ordered repercussions throughout 
the body, felt as clearly marked colourings of consciousness. 
These patterns in organic response are fear, grief, joy, anger 
and the other emotional states. They arise for the most part 
when permanent or periodical tendencies of the individual are 
suddenly either facilitated or frustrated. Thus they depend far 
less upon the nature of the external stimulus than upon the general 
internal circumstances of the individual’s life at the time the 
stimulus occurs. These emotional states, with pleasure and unpleasure, 
are customarily distinguished under the head of feeling<a id="note13.1text"></a><a href="#note13.1">*</a> from 
sensations, which are, as we have seen, very closely dependent 
for their character upon their stimulus. Thus sensations are 
ranked together as cognitive elements, concerned, that is, with 
our knowledge of things rather than with our attitude or behaviour 
towards them, or our emotion about them. Pleasure, however, and 
emotion have, on our view, also a cognitive aspect. They give 
us knowledge; in the case of pleasure, of how our activities 
are going on, successfully or otherwise; in the case of emotion, 
knowledge primarily of our attitudes. But emotion may give us 
further knowledge. It is a remarkable fact that persons with 
exceptional colour sense apparently judge most accurately whether 
two colours are the same, for example, or whether they have or 
have not some definite harmonic relation to one another, not 
by attentive optical comparison or examination, but by the general 
emotional or organic reaction which the colours evoke when simply 
glanced at. This is an indirect way of becoming aware of the 
specific nature of the external world, but none the less a very 
valuable way. A similar method is probably involved in those 
apparently immediate judgments of the moral character of persons 
met with for the first time which many people make so readily 
and successfully. They may be quite unable to mention any definite 
feature of the person upon which their judgment could be based. 
It is none the less often extraordinarily just and discriminating. 
The remarkable sensitiveness to its mother’s expression which 
the infant shows is a striking example. The part played by this 
kind of judgment in all æsthetic appreciation need not be insisted 
upon. It is notable that artists are often pre-eminently adepts 
at such judgments. The topic is usually discussed under the wide 
and vague heading of intuition; a rubric which completely obscures 
and befogs the issues. </p>

<p>For such judgments are not a simpler and more direct way of taking 
cognisance of things, but a more indirect and more complex way. 
It is not thereby shown to be a less primitive process. On the 
contrary, simplified ways of thinking are commonly advanced products. 
The ‘intuitive’ person uses his cœnesthesia as a chemist uses 
his reagents or a physiologist his galvanometer. As far as the 
sensations which the colour stimuli excite can be optically discriminated, 
no difference is perceptible. But an actual yet sensorily imperceptible 
difference becomes apparent through the difference in organic 
reaction. The process is merely one of adding further and more 
delicate signs to the situation, it is analogous to attaching 
a recording lever to a barograph. </p>

<p>The differences between sensitive or ‘intuitive’ and more ‘rational’ 
and obtuse individuals may be of two kinds. It may be that the 
sensitive person’s organic response is more delicate. This is 
a difficult matter to decide. It is certain, however, that the 
chief difference (a derivative difference very likely) lies in 
the fact that the obtuse person has not learned to <i>interpret</i> 
the changes in his general bodily consciousness in any systematic 
fashion. The changes may occur and occur systematically, but 
they mean nothing definite to him. </p>

<p>This kind of intervention of organic sensation in perception 
plays a part in all the arts. Much neglected, it is probably 
of very great importance. What here needs to be noticed is that 
it is not a mode of gaining knowledge which differs in any essential 
way from other modes. No unique and peculiar relation of ‘feeling’ 
towards things needs to be introduced to explain it, any more 
than a unique and peculiar mode of ‘cognitively apprehending’ 
them needs to be introduced to explain ordinary knowing. In both 
instances their causes, which have to be assumed in any case, 
will suffice. When we sense something our sensation is caused 
by what we sense. When we refer to something absent, a present 
sensation similar to sensations which in the past have been coincident 
with it, is thereby a sign for it, and so on, through more and 
more intricate mnemic sign-situations. Here a present colour 
sensation gives rise to an organic response which has in the 
past accompanied a definite colour; the response becomes then 
a sign of that colour which the sensitive and discriminating 
person trusts, although he is optically unable to make sure whether 
that colour is present or merely one very like it. Other cases 
differ from this in complexity but not in principle. If it is 
objected that this account of referring or thinking in terms 
of causes gives us at best but a very indirect way of knowing, 
the reply is that the prevalence of error is itself a strong 
argument against a too direct theory of knowledge. </p>

<p>In popular parlance the term ‘emotion’ stands for those happenings 
in minds which accompany such exhibitions of unusual excitement 
as weeping, shouting, blushing, trembling, and so on. But in 
the usage of most critics it has taken an extended sense, thereby 
suffering quite needlessly in its usefulness. For them it stands 
for any noteworthy ‘goings on’ in the mind almost regardless 
of their nature. The true and profound emotions, as spoken of 
by critics, are often lacking in all the characteristics which 
govern the more refined linguistic usage of common people, and, 
as it happens, of psychologists also, for what may perhaps be 
regarded now as the standard usage in psychology, sets out from 
the very same bodily changes accompanying experience as were 
noted above. </p>

<p>Two main features characterise every emotional experience. One 
of these is a diffused reaction in the organs of the body brought 
about through the sympathetic systems. The other is a tendency 
to action of some definite kind or group of kinds. These extensive 
changes in the visceral and vascular systems, characteristically 
in respiration and in glandular secretion, commonly take place 
in response to situations which call some instinctive tendency 
into play. As a result of all these changes a tide of sensations 
of internal bodily origin comes into consciousness. It is generally 
agreed that these sensations make up at least the main part of 
the peculiar consciousness of an emotion. Whether they are necessary 
to it or not is disputed. It may perhaps be suggested that insufficient 
attention has been paid in the theory of emotion to images of 
such sensations. The fact that fear, for example, may be felt 
in the absence of any detectable bodily changes of the kind described 
(a disputed fact) may be explained by supposing images of these 
sensations to be taking their place. </p>

<p>These sensations, or images of them, are then a main ingredient 
of an emotional experience and account for its peculiar ‘colour’ 
or tone, for the voluminousness and massiveness as well as for 
the extreme acuteness of emotions. But of equal or greater importance 
are the changes in consciousness due to reactions in the nervous 
systems which control movement, governing muscular response to 
the stimulating situation. These range, in the case of fear, 
from the awakening of a simple tendency, an impulse to run away 
or hide under the table, to such elaborate readjustments as we 
make when we prepare to counter a threat against some favourite 
opinion. As a rule a process of extraordinary complexity takes 
place between perceiving the situation and finding a mode of 
meeting it. This complicated process contributes the rest of 
its peculiar flavour to an emotional experience. </p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">So</span> far we have alluded only casually to memory, to that apparent 
revival of past experience to which the richness and complexity 
of experience is due. Every stimulus which is ever received leaves 
behind it, so it is said, an imprint, a trace capable of being 
revived later and of contributing its quota to consciousness 
and to behaviour. To these effects of past experience the systematic, 
the organised character of our behaviour is due; the fact that 
they intervene is the explanation of our ability to learn by 
experience. It is a way peculiar to living tissue by which the 
past influences our present behaviour across, as it might appear, 
a gulf of time. </p>

<p>How we should conceive this influence is perhaps the most puzzling 
point in psychology. The old theory of a kind of Somerset House 
of past impressions has given place to an account in terms of 
facilitations of neural paths, lowered resistances in synapses, 
and so forth. It was natural that as the broad outlines of neural 
activity came to be known, psychologists should attempt to make 
use of them. But on close examination it is clear that their 
interpretations were far too crude. Fixed ‘paths’, one for every 
item of experience which has ever taken place, and others for 
every kind of connection into which the items come, however multitudinous 
we make them, no longer explain what can be observed in behaviour 
and experience. As Von Kries and, more recently, Koffka have 
insisted, the fact, for example, that we <i>recognise</i> things 
in cases where it is certain that quite different paths must 
be involved, is fatal to the scheme. And mere multiplication 
of the entities invoked leads to no solution. Semon even goes 
so far as to say that when we listen to a song for the hundredth 
time we hear not only the singer but a chorus of nine and ninety 
mnemic voices. This corollary by itself is almost a refutation 
of his theory. </p>

<p>We have to escape from the crude assumption that the only way 
in which what is past can be repeated is by records being kept. 
The old associationists supposed the records to be writ small 
inside separate cells. The more modern view was that they were 
scored large through a deepening of the channels of conduction. 
Neither view is adequate. </p>

<p>Imagine an energy system of prodigious complexity and extreme 
delicacy of organisation which has an indefinitely large number 
of stable poises. Imagine it thrown from one poise to another 
with great facility, each poise being the resultant of all the 
energies of the system. Suppose now that the <i>partial</i> return 
of a situation which has formerly caused it to assume a stable 
poise, throws it into an unstable condition, from which it most 
easily returns to equilibrium by reassuming the former poise. 
Such a system would exhibit the phenomena of memory; but it would 
keep no records though appearing to do so. The appearance would 
be due merely to the extreme accuracy and sensitiveness of the 
system and the delicacy of its balances. Its state on the later 
occasion would appear to be a <i>revival</i> of its state on 
the former, but this would not be the case any more than a cumulus 
cloud this evening is a revival of those which decorated the 
heavens last year. </p>

<p>This imaginary construction can be made more concrete by imagining 
a solid with a large number of facets upon any one of which it 
can rest. If we try to balance it upon one of its coigns or ridges 
it settles down upon the nearest facet. In the case of the neural 
system we are trying to suggest each stable poise has been determined 
by a definite set, or better, context of conditions. Membership 
of this context is what corresponds to nearness to a facet. The 
partial return of the context causes the system to behave as 
though conditions were present which are not, and this is what 
is essential in memory. </p>

<p>That this suggestion in the form here presented is unsatisfactory 
and incomplete is evident. It is wildly conjectural no doubt, 
but so are the Archival and Pathway Theories. Yet it does avoid 
the chief deficiencies of those theories, it does suggest why 
only some conjunctions of experiences become ‘associated’, those 
namely which yield a stable poise. And it suggests why a thing 
should be recognised as the same though appearing in countless 
different aspects; every time it appears different conditions 
occur which, none the less, lead to one and the same stable poise, 
as the polyhedron we imagined may settle down on one and the 
same facet from all the surrounding ridges. </p>

<p>One of the collateral advantages of such a view is that it removes 
some of the temptations to revert to animism from which psychologists, 
and especially literary psychologists, suffer. Dissatisfaction 
with current hypotheses as to the mechanism of reflex arcs is 
a main cause for the scientifically desperate belief in the soul. 
And apart from this, the special emotive factors which disturb 
judgment on this point are less obtrusive when this account is 
substituted for the usual story of the conditioned reflex, that 
sacrilegious contrivance of the mechanists. </p>

<p>There is no kind of mental activity in which memory does not 
intervene. We are most familiar with it in the case of images, 
those fugitive elusive copies of sensations with which psychology 
has been hitherto so much, perhaps too much, concerned. Visual 
images are the best known of them, but it is important to recognise 
that every kind of sensation may have its corresponding image. 
Visceral, kinæsthetic, thermal images can with a little practice 
be produced, even by people who have never noticed their occurrence. 
But individual differences as regards imagery are enormous, more 
in the degree to which images become conscious, however, than 
in their actual presence or absence on the needful occasion. 
Those people who, by their own report, are devoid of images, 
none the less behave in a way which makes it certain that the 
same processes are at work in them as in producers of the most 
flamboyant images. </p>

</div></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> interventions of memory are not confined to sensation and 
emotion. They are of equal importance in our active behaviour. 
The acquisition of any muscular accomplishment, dancing or billiards, 
for example, shows this clearly. What we have already done in 
the past controls what we shall do in the future. If the perception 
of an object and the recognition that it is a tree, for example, 
involve a poise in the sensory system concerned, a certain completeness 
or ‘closure,’ to use the term employed by Kohler, so an act, 
as opposed to a random movement, involves a similar poise in 
a motor system. But sensory and motor systems are not independent; 
they work together; every perception probably includes a response 
in the form of incipient action. We constantly overlook the extent 
to which all the while we are making preliminary adjustments, 
getting ready to act in one way or another. Reading Captain Slocum’s 
account of the centipede which bit him on the head when alone 
in the middle of the Atlantic, the writer has been caused to 
leap right out of his chair by a leaf which fell upon his face 
from a tree. Only occasionally does some such accident show how 
extensive are the motor adjustments made in what appear to be 
the most unmuscular occupations. </p>

<p>This incipient activity stands to overt action much as an image 
stands to a sensation. But such ‘imaginal’ activity is, by its 
very nature, extraordinarily hard to detect or to experiment 
upon. Psychology has only dealt with fringes of the mind hitherto 
and the most accessible fringe is on the side of sensation. We 
have therefore to build up our conjectures as to the rest of 
mental happenings by analogy with the perhaps not entirely representative 
specimens which sensation supplies. This limitation has led the 
majority of psychologists to see in imaginal movement no more 
than images of the <i>sensations</i> from muscle, joint, and 
tendon, which would arise if the movement were actually made. </p>

<p>It is certain that before any action takes place a preliminary 
organisation must occur which ensures that the parts do not get 
in one another’s way. It appears to the writer that these preliminaries 
in his case make up part of consciousness, but there is a heavy 
weight of authority against him. The point is no doubt exceptionally 
hard to determine. </p>

<p>In any case, whether the consciousness of activity is due to 
sensations and images of movements alone, or whether the outgoing 
part of the impulse and its preparatory organisation help to 
make up consciousness, there is no doubt about the importance 
of incipient and imaginal movement in experience. The work done 
by Lipps, Groos and others on <i>einfühlung</i>, or empathy, 
however we may prefer to restate their results, shows that when 
we perceive spatial or musical form we commonly accompany our 
perception with closely connected motor activity. We cannot leave 
this activity out of our account of what happens in the experiences 
of the arts, although we may think that those who have built 
upon this fact what they have put forward as a complete æsthetic—Vernon 
Lee, for example—have been far from clear as to what questions 
they were answering.  </p>

<p>The extent to which any activity is conscious seems to depend 
very largely upon how complex and how novel it is. The primitive 
and in a sense natural outcome of stimulus is action; the more 
simple the situation with which the mind is engaged, the closer 
is the connection between the stimulus and some overt response 
in action, and in general the less rich and full is the consciousness 
attendant. A man walking over uneven ground, for example, makes 
without reflection or emotion a continuous adjustment of his 
steps to his footing; but let the ground become precipitous and, 
unless he is used to such places, both reflection and emotion 
will appear. The increased complexity of the situation and the 
greater delicacy and appropriateness of the movements required 
for convenience and safety, call forth far more complicated goings 
on in the mind. Besides his perception of the nature of the ground, 
the thought may occur that a false move would be perilous and 
difficult to retrieve. This, when accompanied by emotion, is 
called a ‘realisation’ of his situation. The adjustment to one 
another of varied impulses—to go forward carefully, to lie down 
and grasp something with the hands, to go back, and so forth—and 
their co-ordination into useful behaviour alters the whole character 
of his experience. </p>

<p>Most behaviour is a reconciliation between the various acts which 
would satisfy the different impulses which combine to produce 
it; and the richness and interest of the feel of it in consciousness 
depends upon the variety of the impulses engaged. Any familiar 
activity, when set in different conditions so that the impulses 
which make it up have to adjust themselves to fresh streams of 
impulses due to the new conditions, is likely to take on increased 
richness and fullness in consciousness. </p>

<p>This general fact is of great importance for the arts, particularly 
for poetry, painting and sculpture, the representative or mimetic 
arts. For in these a totally new setting for what may be familiar 
elements is essentially involved. Instead of seeing a tree we 
see something in a picture which may have similar effects upon 
us but is <i>not</i> a tree. The tree impulses which are aroused 
have to adjust themselves to their new setting of other impulses 
due to our awareness that it is a <i>picture</i> which we are 
looking at. Thus an opportunity arises for those impulses to 
define themselves in a way in which they ordinarily do not. </p>

<p>This, of course, is only the most obvious and simple instance 
of the way in which, thanks to the unusual circumstances in which 
things depicted, or in literature described, come before us, 
the experiences that result are modified. To take another obvious 
example, the description or the theatrical presentation of a 
murder has a different effect upon us from that which would be 
produced by most actual murders if they took place before us. 
These considerations, of vast importance in the discussion of 
artistic form, will occupy us later (pp. 145, 237). Here it is 
sufficient to point out that these differences between ordinary 
experiences and those due to works of art are only special cases 
of the general difference between experiences made up of a less 
and of a greater number of impulses which have to be brought 
into co-ordination with one another. The bearing of this point 
upon the problem of the æsthetic mode with its detachment, impersonality, 
etc., discussed in the second chapter, will be apparent. (Compare 
Chapter XXXII, p. 249.) </p>

<p>The result of the co-ordination of a great number of impulses 
of different kinds is very often that no <i>overt</i> action 
takes place. There is a danger here of supposing that no action 
whatever results or that there is something incomplete or imperfect 
about such a state of affairs. But imaginal action and incipient 
action which does not go so far as actual muscular movement are 
more important than Overt action in the well-developed human 
being. Indeed the difference between the intelligent or refined, 
and the stupid or crass person is a difference in the extent 
to which overt action can be replaced by incipient and imaginal 
action. An intelligent man can ‘see how a thing works’ when a 
less intelligent man has to ‘find out by trying’. Similarly with 
such responses as are aroused by a work of art. The difference 
between ‘understanding’ it and failing to do so is, in most cases, 
a difference between being able to make the required responses 
in an imaginal or incipient degree, adjusting them to one another 
at that stage, and being unable to produce them or adjust them 
except overtly and at their fullest development. Though the kinds 
of activity involved are different, the analogy with the case 
of the mathematician is not misleading. The fact that he will 
not make half so many marks on paper as a schoolboy does not 
show that he is any less active. His activity takes place at 
an earlier stage in which his responses are merely incipient 
or imaginal. In a similar manner the absence of any overt movements 
or external signs of emotion in an experienced reader of poetry, 
or concert-goer, compared to the evident disturbances which are 
sometimes to be seen in the novice, is no indication of any lack 
of internal activity. The response required in many cases by 
works of art is of a kind which can only be obtained in an incipient 
or imaginal stage. Practical considerations often prevent their 
being worked out in overt form, and this is, as a rule, not in 
the least to be regretted. For these responses are commonly of 
the nature of solutions to problems, not of intellectual research, 
but of emotional accommodation and adjustment, and can usually 
be best achieved while the different impulses which have to be 
reconciled are still in an incipient or imaginal stage, and before 
the matter has become further complicated by the irrelevant accidents 
which attend overt responses. </p>

<p>These imaginal and incipient activities or tendencies to action, 
I shall call attitudes. When we realise how many and how different 
may be the tendencies awakened by a situation, and what scope 
there is for conflict, suppression and interplay—all contributing 
something to our experience—it will not appear surprising that 
the classification and analysis of attitudes is not yet far advanced. 
A thousand tendencies to actions, which do not overtly take place, 
may well occur in complicated adjustments. For these what evidence 
there is must be indirect. In fact, the only attitudes which 
are capable of clear and explicit analysis are those in which 
some simple mode of observable behaviour gives the clue to what 
has been taking place, and even here only a part of the reaction 
is open to this kind of examination. </p>

<p>Among the experiences which are by the nature of the case hidden 
from observation are found almost all those with which criticism 
is concerned. The outward aspect and behaviour of a man reading 
<i>The Prioresses’ Tale</i> and <i>The Miller’s Tale</i> may 
well be indistinguishable. But this should not lead us to overlook 
how great a part in the whole experience is taken by attitudes. 
Many experiences which, if examined by introspection for their 
actual content of sensation and imagery, differ very little, 
are totally diverse in the kind and degree of implicit activity 
present. This aspect of experiences as filled with incipient 
promptings, lightly stimulated tendencies to acts of one kind 
or another, faint preliminary preparations for doing this or 
that, has been constantly overlooked in criticism. Yet it is 
in terms of attitudes, the resolution, inter-inanimation, and 
balancing of impulses—Aristotle’s definition of Tragedy<a id="note15.1text"></a><a href="#note15.1">*</a> is 
an instance—that all the most valuable effects of poetry must 
be described. </p>

<span class="smcap">The Analysis of a Poem</span> </h2>
<div class ="epigraph">
<p style="text-align: center; text-indent:0em">Toutes choses sont dites déjà, mais comme personne n’écoute <br>
il faut toujours recommencer.—André Gide. </p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> qualifications of a good critic are three. He must be an 
adept at experiencing, without eccentricities, the state of mind 
relevant to the work of art he is judging. Secondly, he must 
be able to distinguish experiences from one another as regards 
their less superficial features. Thirdly, he must be a sound 
judge of values. </p>

<p>Upon all these matters psychology, even in its present conjectural 
state, has a direct bearing. The critic is, throughout, judging 
of experiences, of states of mind; but too often he is needlessly 
ignorant of the general psychological form of the experiences 
with which he is concerned. He has no clear ideas as to the elements 
present or as to their relative importance. Thus, an outline 
or schema of the mental events which make up the experience of 
‘looking at’ a picture or ‘reading’ a poem, can be of great assistance. 
At the very least an understanding of the probable structures 
of these experiences can remove certain misconceptions which 
tend to make the opinions of individuals of less service to other 
individuals than need be. </p>

<p>Two instances will show this. There are certain broad features 
in which all agree a poem of Swinburne is unlike a poem of Hardy. 
The use of words by the two poets is different. Their methods 
are dissimilar, and the proper approach for a reader differs 
correspondingly. An attempt to read them in the same way is unfair 
to one of the poets, or to both, and leads inevitably to defects 
in criticism which a little reflection would remove. It is absurd 
to read Pope as though he were Shelley, but the essential differences 
cannot be clearly marked out unless such an outline of the general 
form of a poetic experience, as is here attempted, has been provided. 
The psychological means employed by these poets are demonstrably 
different. Whether the effects are also dissimilar is a further 
question for which the same kind of analysis is equally required. </p>

<p>This separation inside the poetic experience of certain parts 
which are means from certain other parts which are the ends upon 
which the poetic value of the experience depends, leads up to 
our other instance. It is unquestionable that the actual experiences, 
which even good critics undergo when reading, as we say, <i>the 
same poem</i>, differ very widely. In spite of certain conventions, 
which endeavour to conceal these inevitable discrepancies for 
social purposes, there can be no doubt that the experiences of 
readers in connection with particular poems are rarely similar. 
This is unavoidable. Some differences are, however, much more 
important than others. Provided the ends, in which the value 
of the poem lies, are attained, differences in the means need 
not prevent critics from agreement or from mutual service. Those 
discrepancies alone are fatal which affect the fundamental features 
of experiences, the features upon which their <i>value</i> depends. 
But enough is now known of the ways in which minds work for superficial 
and fundamental parts of experiences to be distinguished. One 
of the greatest living critics praises the line: </p>

<div class="poetry"><p style="text-align: center; text-indent:0em; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em">The fringed curtain of thine eyes advance, </p></div>

<p class="noindent">for the ‘ravishing beauty’ of the visual images excited. This 
common mistake of exaggerating personal accidents in the means 
by which a poem attains its end into the chief value of the poem 
is due to excessive trust in the commonplaces<a id="note16.1text"></a><a href="#note16.1">*</a> of psychology. </p>

<div class="fig">
<img alt="Illustration: Arcadia, Night, a Cloud, Pan, and the Moon" src="images/illustration.jpg" style="width:100%;" id="illustration">
</div>

<p>In the analysis of the experience of reading a poem, a diagram, 
or hieroglyph, is convenient, provided that its limitations are 
clearly recognised. The spatial relations of the parts of the 
diagram, for instance, are not intended to stand for spatial 
relations between parts of what is represented; it is not a picture 
of the nervous system. Nor are temporal relations intended. Spatial 
metaphors, whether drawn as diagrams or merely imagined, are 
dangers only to the unwary. The essential service which pictures 
can give in abstract matters, namely, the simultaneous and compact 
representation of states of affairs which otherwise tend to remain 
indistinct and confused, is worth the slight risk of misunderstanding 
which they entail. </p>

<p>We may begin then with a diagrammatic representation of the events 
which take place when we read a poem. Other literary experiences 
will only differ from this in their greater simplicity. </p>

<p>The eye is depicted as reading a succession of printed words. 
As a result there follows a stream of reaction in which six distinct 
kinds of events may be distinguished. </p>

<table>
    <tr>
      <td>I</td>
      <td>The visual sensations of the printed words.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>II</td>
      <td>Images very closely associated with these sensations.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>III</td>
      <td>Images relatively free.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>IV</td>
      <td>References to, or ‘thinkings of,’ various things.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>V</td>
      <td>Emotions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VI</td>
      <td>Affective-volitional attitudes.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p>Each of these kinds of occurrences requires some brief description 
and explanation. </p>

<p>Upon the visual sensations of the printed words all the rest 
depends (in the case of a reader not previously acquainted with 
the poem); but with most readers they have in themselves no great 
importance. The individual shapes of the letters, their size 
and spacing, have only a minor effect upon the whole reaction. 
No doubt readers differ greatly in this respect; with some, familiarity 
plays a great part. They find it unpleasant and disturbing to 
read a poem in any but the edition in which they first became 
acquainted with it. But the majority of readers are less exigent. 
Provided that the print is clear and legible, and allows the 
habitual eye-movements of reading to be easily performed, the 
full response arises equally well from widely differing sensations. 
Those for whom this is true have, in the present state of economic 
organisation, a decided advantage over the more fastidious. This 
does not show that good printing is a negligible consideration; 
and the primary place of calligraphy in the Chinese arts is an 
indication to the contrary. It shows merely that printing belongs 
to another branch of the arts. In the poetic experience words 
take effect through their associated images, and through what 
we are, as a rule, content to call their meaning. What meaning 
is and how it enters into the experience we shall consider. </p>

<p><i>Tied Images</i>.—Visual sensations of words do not commonly 
occur by themselves. They have certain regular companions so 
closely tied to them as to be only with difficulty disconnected. 
The chief of these are the auditory image—the sound of the words 
in the mind’s ear—and the image of articulation—the feel in the 
lips, mouth, and throat, of what the words would be like to speak. </p>

<p>Auditory images of words are among the most obvious of mental 
happenings. Any line of verse or prose slowly read, will, for 
most people, sound mutely in the imagination somewhat as it would 
if read aloud. But the degree of correspondence between the image-sounds, 
and the actual sounds that the reader would produce, varies enormously. 
Many people are able to imagine word-sounds with greater delicacy 
and discrimination than they can utter them. But the reverse 
case is also found. What importance then is to be attached to 
clear, rich and delicate sound imagery in silent reading? How 
far must people who differ in their capacity to produce such 
images differ in their total reactions to poems? And what are 
the advantages of reading aloud? Here we reach one of the practical 
problems of criticism for which this analysis is required. A 
discussion is best postponed until the whole analysis has been 
given. The principal confusion which prevents a clear understanding 
of the point at issue does, however, concern images and may be 
dealt with here. It is of great importance in connection with 
the topic of the following section. </p>

<p>The sensory qualities of images, their vivacity, clearness, fullness 
of detail and so on, do not bear any constant relation to their 
effects. Images differing in these respects may have closely 
similar consequences. Too much importance has always been attached 
to the sensory qualities of images. What gives an image efficacy 
is less its vividness as an image than its character as a mental 
event peculiarly connected with sensation. Lissette way which 
no one yet knows how to explain, a relict of sensation and our 
intellectual and emotional response to it depends far more upon 
its being, through this fact, a representative of a sensation, 
than upon its sensory resemblance to one. An image may lose almost 
all its sensory nature to the point of becoming scarcely an image 
at all, a mere skeleton, and yet represent a sensation quite 
as adequately as if it were flaring with hallucinatory vividity. 
In other words, what matters is not the sensory <i>resemblance</i> 
of an image to the sensation which is its prototype, but some 
other relation, at present hidden from us in the jungles of neurology. 
(Cf. Chapter XIV.) </p>

<p>Care then should be taken to avoid the natural tendency to suppose 
that the more clear and vivid an image the greater will be its 
efficacy. There are trustworthy people who, according to their 
accounts, never experience any imagery at all. If certain views 
commonly expressed about the arts are true, by which vivid imagery 
is an all-important part of the experience, then these people 
are incapable of art experiences, a conclusion which is contrary 
to the facts. The views in question are overlooking the fact 
that <i>something</i> takes the place of vivid images in these 
people, and that, provided the image-substitute is efficacious, 
their lack of mimetic imagery is of no consequence. The efficacy 
required must, of course, include control over emotional as well 
as intellectual reactions. Needless perhaps to add that with 
persons of the image-producing types an increase in delicacy 
and vivacity in their imagery will probably be accompanied by 
increased subtlety in effects. Thus it is not surprising that 
certain great poets and critics have been remarkable for the 
vigour of their imagery, and dependent upon it. No one would 
deny the usefulness of imagery to some people; the mistake is 
to suppose that it is indispensable to all. </p>

<p>Articulatory imagery is less noticeable; yet the quality of silent 
speech is perhaps even more dependent upon these images than 
upon sound-images. Collocations of syllables which are awkward 
or unpleasant to utter are rarely delightful to the ear. As a 
rule the two sets of images are so intimately connected that 
it is difficult to decide which is the offender. In ‘Heaven, 
which man’s generation draws,’ the sound doubtless is as harsh 
as the movements required are cramping to the lips. </p>

<p>The extent to which interference with one set of images will 
change the other may be well seen by a simple experiment. Most 
people, if they attempt a silent recitation while opening the 
mouth to its fullest stretch or holding the tongue firmly between 
the teeth, will notice curious transformations in the auditory 
images. How the experiment should be interpreted is uncertain, 
but it is of use in making the presence of both kinds of verbal 
imagery evident to those who may have overlooked them hitherto. 
Images of articulation should not, however, be confused with 
those minimal actual movements which for some people (for all, 
as behaviourists maintain) accompany the silent rehearsing of 
words. </p>

<p>These two forms of tied imagery might also be called verbal images, 
and supply the elements of what is called the ‘formal structure’ 
of poetry. They differ from those to which we now proceed in 
being images of words, not of things words stand for, and in 
their very close connection with the visual sensations of printed 
words. </p>

<p><i>Free Imagery</i>.—Free images, or rather one form of these, 
visual images, pictures in the mind’s eye, occupy a prominent 
place in the literature of criticism, to the neglect somewhat 
of other forms of imagery, since, as was remarked in a preceding 
chapter, for every possible kind of sensation there is a corresponding 
possible image. </p>

<p>The assumption, natural before investigation, that all attentive 
and sensitive readers will experience the same images, vitiates 
most of the historical discussions from that of Longinus to that 
of Lessing. Even in the present day, when there is no excuse 
for such ignorance, the mistake still thrives, and an altogether 
too crude, too hasty, and too superficial form of criticism is 
allowed to pass unchallenged. It cannot be too clearly recognised 
that individuals differ not only in the type of imagery which 
they employ, but still more in the particular images which they 
produce. In their whole reactions to a poem, or to a single line 
of it, their free images are the point at which two readings 
are most likely to differ, and the fact that they differ may 
very well be quite immaterial. Fifty different readers will experience 
not one common picture but fifty different pictures. If the value 
of the poem derived from the value <i>qua</i> picture of the 
visual image excited then criticism might well despair. Those 
who would stress this part of the poetic reaction can have but 
crude views on pictures. </p>

<p>But if the value of the visual image in the experience is not 
pictorial, if the image is not to be judged as a picture, how 
is it to be judged? It is improbable that the many critics, some 
of them peculiarly well qualified in the visual arts, who have 
insisted upon the importance of imagery, have been entirely wasting 
their time. It ought to be possible to give an account of the 
place of free imagery in the whole poetic experience which will 
explain this insistence. What is required will be found if we 
turn our attention from the sensory qualities of the imagery 
to the more fundamental qualities upon which its efficacy in 
modifying the rest of the experience depends. It has been urged 
above that images which are different in their sensory qualities 
may have the same effects. If this were not the case the absence 
of glaring differences between people of different image-types 
would be astonishing. But since images may represent sensations 
without resembling them, and represent them in the sense of replacing 
them, as far as effects in directing thought and arousing emotion 
go, differences in their mimetic capacity become of minor importance. 
As we have seen, it is natural for those whose imagery is vivid, 
to suppose that vivacity and clearness go together with power 
over thought and feeling. It is the power of an image over these 
that is as a rule being praised when an intelligent and sensitive 
critic appears merely to be praising the picture floating before 
his mind’s eye. To judge the image as a picture is judged, would, 
as we have seen, be absurd; and what is sought in poetry by those 
painters and others whose interest in the world is primarily 
visual is not pictures but records of observation, or stimuli 
of emotion. </p>

<p>Thus, provided the images (or image-substitutes for the imageless) 
have the due effects, deficiencies in their sensory aspect do 
not matter. But the proviso is important. In all forms of imagery 
sensory deficiencies are for many people signs and accompaniments 
of defective efficacy, and the habit of reading so as to allow 
the fullest development to imagery in its sensory aspect is likely 
to encourage the full development of this more essential feature, 
its efficacy, if the freaks and accidents of the sensory side 
are not taken too seriously. </p>

<p>Some exceptions to this general recommendation will occur to 
the reader. Instances in plenty may be found in which a full 
development of the sensory aspect of images is damaging to their 
effects. Meredith is a master of this peculiar kind of imagery:— </p>

<div class="poetry"><p style="padding-left:20%; text-indent:0em; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em">Thus piteously Love closed what he begat <br>
The union of this ever diverse pair! <br>
These two were rapid falcons in a snare, <br>
Condemned to do the flitting of the bat. </p></div>

<p>The emotional as well as the intellectual effects of the various 
images here suggested are much impaired if we produce them vividly 
and distinctly. </p>

<p><i>Impulses, and References</i>.—We have now to consider those 
more fundamental effects upon which stress has been laid above 
as the true places of the values of the experience. It will be 
well at this point to reconsult the diagram. The vertical lines 
which run capriciously downwards from the visual sensations of 
the words, through their tied imagery and onward to the bottom 
of the diagram, are intended to represent, schematically, streams 
of impulses flowing through in the mind. </p>

<p>They start in the visual sensations, but the depiction of the 
tied imagery is intended to show how much of their further course 
is due to it. The placing of the free imagery in the third division 
is intended to suggest that while some free images may arise 
from visual words alone, they take their character in a large 
part as a consequence of the tied imagery. Thus the great importance 
of the tied imagery, of the formal elements, is emphasised in 
the diagram. </p>

<p>These impulses are the weft of the experience, the warp being 
the pre-existing systematic structure of the mind, that organised 
system of possible impulses. The metaphor is of course inexact, 
since weft and warp here are not independent. Where these impulses 
run, and how they develop, depends entirely upon the condition 
of the mind, and this depends upon the impulses which have previously 
been active in it. It will be seen then that impulses—their 
direction, their strength, how they modify one another—are the 
essential and fundamental things in any experience. All else, 
whether intellectual or emotional, arises as a consequence of 
their activity. The thin trickle of stimulation which comes in 
through the eye finds an immense hierarchy of systems of tendencies 
poised in the most delicate stability. It is strong enough and 
rightly enough directed to disturb some of these without assistance. 
The literal sense of a word can be grasped on the prompting of 
the mere sight of it, without hearing it or mentally pronouncing 
it. But the effects of this stimulation are immensely increased 
and widened when it is reinforced by fresh stimulation from tied 
images, and it is through these that most of the emotional effects 
are produced. As the agitation proceeds new reinforcement comes 
with every fresh system which is excited. Thus, the paradoxical 
fact that so trifling an irritation as the sight of marks on 
paper is able to arouse the whole energies of the mind becomes 
explicable. </p>

<p>To turn now to references, the only mental happenings which are 
as closely connected with visual words as their tied images are 
those mysterious events which are usually called thoughts. Thus 
the arrow symbol in the hieroglyph should perhaps properly be 
placed near the visual impression of the word. The mere sight 
of any familiar word is normally followed by a thought of whatever 
the word may stand for. This thought is sometimes said to be 
the ‘meaning’, the literal or prose ‘meaning’ of the word. It 
is wise, however, to avoid the use of ‘meaning’ as a symbol altogether. 
The terms ‘thought’ and ‘idea’ are less subtle in their ambiguities, 
and when defined may perhaps be used without confusion. </p>

<p>What is essential in thought is its direction or reference to 
things. What is this direction or reference? How does a thought 
come to be ‘of’ one thing rather than another? What is the link 
between a thought and what it is ‘of’? The outline of one answer 
to these questions has been suggested in Chapter XI. A further 
account must here be attempted. Without a fairly clear, although, 
of course, incomplete view, it is impossible to avoid confusion 
and obscurity in discussing such topics as truth in art, the 
intellect-<i>versus</i>-emotion <i>imbroglio</i>, the scope of 
science, the nature of religion and many others with which criticism 
must deal. </p>

<p>The facts upon which speculations as to the relations between 
thoughts and the things which they are ‘of’ have been based, 
have as a rule been taken from introspection. But the facts which 
introspection yields are notoriously uncertain, and the special 
position of the observer may well preclude success. Introspection 
is competent, in some cases, to discover the relations between 
events which take place within the mind, but cannot by itself 
give information as to the relations of these events with the 
external world, and it is precisely this which we are inquiring 
into when we ask, What connection is there between a thought 
and that which it is a thought of? For an answer to this question 
we must look further. </p>

<p>There is no doubt that causal relations hold between events in 
the mind and events outside it. Sometimes these relations are 
fairly simple. The striking of a clock is the cause of our thinking 
of its striking. In such a case the external thing is linked 
with the thought ‘of’ it in a fairly direct fashion, and the 
view here taken is that to be a thought ‘of’ the striking is 
to be merely a thought caused in this fashion by the striking. 
A thought of the striking is nothing else and nothing more than 
a thought caused by it. </p>

<p>But most thoughts are ‘of’ things which are not present and not 
producing direct effects in the mind. This is so when we read. 
What is directly affecting the mind is words on paper, but the 
thoughts aroused are not thoughts ‘of’ the words, but of other 
things which the words <i>stand for</i>. How, then, can a causal 
theory of thinking explain the relation between these remote 
things and the thoughts which are ‘of’ them? To answer this we 
must look at the way in which we learn what words stand for. 
Without a process of learning we should only think of the words. </p>

<p>The process of learning to use words is not difficult to analyse. 
On a number of occasions the word is heard in connection with 
objects of a certain kind. Later the word is heard in the absence 
of any such object. In accordance with one of the few fundamental 
laws known about mental process, something then happens in the 
mind which is like what would happen if such an object were actually 
present and engaging the attention. The word has become a <i>sign</i> 
of an object of that kind. The word which formerly was a part 
of the cause of a certain effect in the mind is now followed 
by a similar effect in the absence of the rest of the previous 
cause, namely, an object of the kind in question. This kind of 
causation appears to be peculiar to living tissue. The relation 
now between the thought and what it is ‘of’ is more indirect, 
the thought is ‘of’ something which formerly was part cause, 
together with the sign, of similar thoughts. It is ‘of’ the missing 
part of the sign, or more strictly ‘of’ anything which would 
complete the sign as a cause. </p>

<p>Thoughts by this account are general, they are of anything <i>like</i> 
such and such things, except when the object thought of and the 
thought are connected by direct causal relations, as, for instance, 
when we think of a word we are hearing. Only when these direct 
relations hold can we succeed in thinking simply of ‘That’. We 
have to think instead of ‘something of a kind’. By various means, 
however, we can contrive that there shall only be one thing of 
the kind, and so the need for particularity in our thoughts is 
satisfied. The commonest way in which we do this is by thoughts 
which make the kind spatial and temporal. A thought of ‘mosquito’ 
becomes a thought of ‘mosquito there now’ by combining a thought 
of ‘thing of mosquito kind’ with a thought of ‘thing of there 
kind’ and a thought of ‘thing of now kind’. The awkwardness of 
these phrases, it may be mentioned, is irrelevant. Combined thoughts 
of this sort, we may notice, are capable of truth and falsity, 
whereas a simple thought—of ‘whatever is now’ for instance—can 
only be true. Whether a thought is true or false depends simply 
upon whether there is anything of the kind referred to, and there 
must be something now. It is by no means certain that there must 
be anything there always. And most probably no mosquito is where 
we thought it was then. </p>

<p>The natural generality and vagueness of all reference which is 
not made specific by the aid of space and time is of great importance 
for the understanding of the senses in which poetry may be said 
to be true. (Cf. Chapter XXXV.) </p>

<p>In the reading of poetry the thought due simply to the words, 
their <i>sense</i> it may be called, comes first; but other thoughts 
are not of less importance. These may be due to the auditory 
verbal imagery, and we have onomatopœia,<a id="note16.2text"></a><a href="#note16.2">*</a> but this is rarely 
independent of the sense. More important are the further thoughts 
caused by the sense, the network of interpretation and conjecture 
which arises therefrom, with its opportunities for aberrations 
and misunderstanding. Poems, however, differ fundamentally in 
the extent to which such further interpretation is necessary. 
The mere sense without any further reflection is very often sufficient 
thought, in Swinburne, for instance, for the full response— </p>

<div class="poetry"><p style="padding-left:20%; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top:1em">There glowing ghosts of flowers </p>
<p style="padding-left:20%; font-size: 0.9em">Draw down, draw nigh; </p>
<p style="padding-left:20%; font-size: 0.9em">And wings of swift spent hours </p>
<p style="padding-left:25%; font-size: 0.9em">Take flight and fly; </p>
<p style="padding-left:20%; font-size: 0.9em">She sees by formless gleams </p>
<p style="padding-left:20%; font-size: 0.9em">She hears across cold streams </p>
<p style="padding-left:25%; font-size: 0.9em; margin-bottom: 1em">Dead mouths of many dreams that sing and sigh. </p></div>

<p>Little beyond vague thoughts of the things the words stand for 
is here required. They do not have to be brought into intelligible 
connection with one another. On the other hand, Hardy would rarely 
reach his full effect through sound and sense alone— </p>

<div class="poetry"><p style="padding-left:20%; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top:1em">‘Who’s in the next room?—who? </p>
<p style="padding-left:30%; font-size: 0.9em">I seemed to see </p>
<p style="padding-left:20%; font-size: 0.9em">Somebody in the dawning passing through </p>
<p style="padding-left:30%; font-size: 0.9em">Unknown to me.’ </p>
<p style="padding-left:20%; font-size: 0.9em; margin-bottom: 1em">‘Nay: you saw nought. He passed invisibly’. </p></div>

<p>Between these and even more extreme cases, every degree of variation 
in the relative importance of sound, sense, and further interpretation, 
between form and content in short, can be found. A temptation 
to which few do not succumb is to suppose that there is some 
‘proper relation’ for these different parts of the experience, 
so that a poem whose parts are in this relation must thereby 
be a greater or better poem than another whose parts are differently 
disposed. This is another instance of the commonest of critical 
mistakes, the confusion of means with ends, of technique with 
value. There is no more a ‘proper place’ for sound or for sense 
in poetry than there is one and only one ‘proper shape’ for an 
animal. A dog is not a defective kind of cat, nor is Swinburne 
a defective kind of Hardy. But this sort of criticism is extraordinarily 
prevalent. The objection to Swinburne on the ground of a lack 
of thought is a popular specimen. </p>

<br>

<p>Within certain types, needless to say, some structures are more 
likely to be successful than others. Given some definite kind 
of effect as the goal, or some definite structure already being 
used, a good deal can of course be said as to the most probable 
means, or as to what may or may not be added. Lyric cannot dispense 
with tied imagery, it is clear, nor can we neglect the character 
of this imagery in reading it. A prose composition has to be 
longer than a lyric to produce an equal definiteness of developed 
effect. Poems in which there is much turmoil of emotion are likely 
to be strongly rhythmical and to be in metre, as we shall see 
when we come to discuss rhythm and metre. Drama can hardly dispense 
with a great deal of conjecture and further interpretation which 
in most forms of the novel is replaced by analysis and explanation, 
and in narrative poetry is commonly omitted altogether; and so 
on. </p>

<p>But no general prescription that in great poetry there <i>must</i> 
always be this or that,—deep thought, superb sound or vivid imagery—is 
more than a piece of ignorant dogmatism. Poetry may be almost 
devoid even of mere sense, let alone thought, or <i>almost</i> 
without sensory (or formal) structure, and yet reach the point 
than which no poem goes further. The second case, however, is 
very rare. Almost always, what seems structureless proves to 
have still a loose and tenuous (it may be an intermittent) structure. 
But we can for example shift the words about very often in Walt 
Whitman without loss, even when he is almost at his best. </p>

<p>It is difficult to represent diagrammatically what takes place 
in thought in any satisfactory fashion. The impulse coming in 
from the visual stimulus of the printed word must be imagined 
as reaching some system in the brain in which effects take place 
not due merely to this present stimulus, but also to past occasions 
on which it has been combined with other stimulations. These 
effects are thoughts; and they in their groupings act as signs 
for yet other thoughts. The little arrows are intended to symbolise 
these references to things outside the mind. </p>

<p><i>Emotions, and Attitudes.</i> </p>

<p>Feeling or emotion is not, we have insisted above, another and 
a rival mode of apprehending nature. So far as a feeling or an 
emotion does refer to anything, it refers in the way described, 
through its origin. Feelings, in fact, are commonly signs, and 
the differences between those who ‘see’ things by intuition, 
or ‘feel’ them, and those who reason them out, is commonly only 
a difference between users of signs and users of symbols. Both 
signs and symbols are means by which our past experience assists 
our present responses. The advantages of symbols, due to the 
ease with which they are controlled and communicated, their public 
nature, as it were, are obvious. Their disadvantages as compared 
with such relatively private signs as emotions or organic sensations 
are perhaps less evident. Words, when used symbolically or scientifically, 
not figuratively and emotively, are only capable of directing 
thought to a comparatively few features of the more common situations. 
But feeling is sometimes a more subtle way of referring, more 
dangerous also, because more difficult to corroborate and to 
control, and more liable to confusion. There is no inherent superiority, 
however, in feeling as opposed to thought, there is merely a 
difference in applicability; nor is there any opposition or clash 
between them except for those who are mistaken either in their 
thinking or in their feeling, or in both. How such mistakes arise 
will be discussed in Chapter XXXIV. </p>

<p>As regards emotions and attitudes little need be added to what 
has already been said. Emotions are primarily signs of attitudes 
and owe their great prominence in the theory of art to this. 
For it is the attitudes evoked which are the all-important part 
of any experience. Upon the texture and form of the attitudes 
involved its value depends. It is not the intensity of the conscious 
experience, its thrill, its pleasure or its poignancy which gives 
it value, but the organisation of its impulses for freedom and 
fullness of life. There are plenty of ecstatic instants which 
are valueless; the character of consciousness at any moment is 
no certain sign of the excellence of the impulses from which 
it arises. It is the most convenient sign that is available, 
but it is very ambiguous and may be very misleading. A more reliable 
but less accessible set of signs can be found in the readiness 
for this or that kind of behaviour in which we find ourselves 
after the experience. Too great insistence upon the quality of 
the momentary <i>consciousness</i> which the arts occasion has 
in recent times been a prevalent critical blunder. The Epilogue 
to Pater’s <i>Renaissance</i> is the <i>locus classicus</i>. 
The after-effects, the permanent modifications in the structure 
of the mind, which works of art can produce, have been overlooked. 
No one is ever quite the same again after any experience, his 
possibilities have altered in some degree. And among all the 
agents by which “the widening of the sphere of human sensibility” 
may be brought about, the arts are the most powerful, since it 
is through them that men may most co-operate and in these experiences 
that the mind most easily and with least interference organises 
itself. </p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Rhythm</span> and its specialised form, metre, depend upon repetition, 
and expectancy. Equally where what is expected recurs and where 
it fails, all rhythmical and metrical effects spring from anticipation. 
As a rule this anticipation is unconscious. Sequences of syllables 
both as sounds and as images of speech-movements leave the mind 
ready for certain further sequences rather than for others. Our 
momentary organisation is adapted to one range of possible stimuli 
rather than to another. Just as the eye reading print unconsciously 
expects the spelling to be as usual, and the fount of type to 
remain the same, so the mind after reading a line or two of verse, 
or half a sentence of prose, prepares itself ahead for any one 
of a number of possible sequences, at the same time negatively 
incapacitating itself for others. The effect produced by what 
actually follows depends very closely upon this unconscious preparation 
and consists largely of the further twist which it gives to expectancy. 
It is in terms of the variation in these twists that rhythm is 
to be described. Both prose and verse vary immensely in the extent 
to which they excite this ‘getting ready’ process, and in the 
narrowness of the anticipation which is formed, Prose on the 
whole, with the rare exceptions of a Landor, a De Quincey, or 
a Ruskin, is accompanied by a very much vaguer and more indeterminate 
expectancy than verse. In such prose as this page, for example, 
little more than a preparedness for further words not all exactly 
alike in sound and with abstract polysyllables preponderating 
is all that arises. In short, the sensory or formal effect of 
words has very little play in the literature of analysis and 
exposition. But as’ soon as prose becomes more emotive than scientific, 
the formal side becomes prominent. </p>

<p>Let us take Landor’s description<a id="note17.1text"></a><a href="#note17.1">†</a> of a lioness suckling her 
young— </p>

<p style="font-size: .85em; padding-top: .5em; padding-bottom: .5em; text-indent: 0.9em">On perceiving the countryman, she drew up her feet gently, 
and squared her mouth, and rounded her eyes, slumberous with 
content; and they looked, he said, like sea-grottoes, obscurely 
green, interminably deep, at once awakening fear and stilling 
and suppressing it. </p>

<p class="noindent">After ‘obscurely green’ would it be possible (quite apart from 
sense) to have ‘deeply dark’ or ‘impenetrably gloomy’? Why, apart 
from sense, can so few of the syllables be changed in vowel sound, 
in emphasis, in duration or otherwise, without disaster to the 
total effect? As with all such questions about sensory form and 
its effects, only an incomplete answer can be given. The expectancy 
caused by what has gone before, a thing which must be thought 
of as a very complex tide of neural settings, lowering the threshold 
for some kinds of stimuli and raising it for others, and the 
character of the stimulus which does actually come, both play 
their part. </p>

<p>Even the most highly organised lyrical or ‘polyphonic’ prose 
raises as it advances only a very ambiguous expectation. Until 
the final words of the passage, there are always a great number 
of different sequences which would equally well fit in, which 
would satisfy the expectancy so far as that is merely due to 
<i>habit</i>, to the routine of <i>sensory stimulation</i>. What 
is expected in fact is not this sound or that sound, not even 
this kind of sound or that kind of sound, but some one of a certain 
thousand kinds of sounds. It is much more a negative thing than 
a positive. As in the case of many social conventions it is easier 
to say what disqualifies than to say what is required. </p>

<p>Into this very indeterminate expectancy the new element comes 
with its own range of possible effects. There is, of course, 
no such thing as <i>the</i> effect of a word or a sound. There 
is no one effect which belongs to it. Words have no intrinsic 
literary characters. None are either ugly or beautiful, intrinsically 
displeasing or delightful. Every word has instead a range of 
possible effects, varying with the conditions into which it is 
received. All that we can say as to the sorting out of words, 
whether into the ‘combed’ and ‘slippery’, the ‘shaggy’ and ‘rumpled’ 
as with Dante, or in any other manner, is that some, through 
long use, have narrower ranges than others and require more extraordinary 
conditions if they are to change their ‘character’. What effect 
the word has is a compromise between some one of its possible 
effects and the special conditions into which it comes. Thus 
in Shakespeare hardly any word ever looks odd until we consider 
it; whereas even in Keats the ‘cold mushrooms’ in the <i>Satyrs’ 
Song</i> give the mind a shock of astonishment, an astonishment 
which is full of delight, but none the less is a shock. </p>

<p>But with this example we have broken down the limitation to the 
mere sound, to the strictly formal or sensory aspect of word 
sequences, and in fact the limitation is useless. For the effect 
of a word as sound cannot be separated from its contemporaneous 
other effects. They become inextricably mingled at once. </p>

<p>The sound gets its character by compromise with what is going 
on already. The preceding agitation of the mind selects from 
a range of possible characters which the word might present, 
that one which best suits with what is happening. There are no 
gloomy and no gay vowels or syllables, and the army of critics 
who have attempted to analyse the effects of passages into vowel 
and consonantal collocations have, in fact, been merely amusing 
themselves. The way in which the sound of a word is taken varies 
with the emotion already in being. But, further, it varies with 
the sense. For the anticipation of the sound due to habit, to 
the routine of sensation, is merely a part of the general expectancy. 
Grammatical regularities, the necessity for completing the thought, 
the reader’s state of conjecture as to what is being said, his 
apprehension in dramatic literature of the action, of the intention, 
situation, state of mind generally, of the speaker, all these 
and many other things intervene. The way the sound is taken is 
much less determined by the sound itself than by the conditions 
into which it enters. All these anticipations form a very closely 
woven network and the word which can satisfy them all simultaneously 
may well seem triumphant. But we should not attribute to the 
sound alone virtues which involve so many other factors. To say 
this is not in the least to belittle the importance of the sound; 
in most cases it is the key to the effects of poetry. This texture 
of expectations, satisfactions, disappointments, surprisals, 
which the sequence of syllables brings about, is rhythm. And 
the sound of words comes to its full power only through rhythm. 
Evidently there can be no surprise and no disappointment unless 
there is expectation and most rhythms perhaps are made up as 
much of disappointments and postponements and surprises and betrayals 
as of simple, straightforward satisfactions. Hence the rapidity 
with which too simple rhythms, those which are too easily ‘seen 
through’, grow cloying or insipid unless hypnoidal states intervene, 
as with much primitive music and dancing and often with metre. </p>

<p>The same definition of rhythm may be extended to the plastic 
arts and to architecture. Temporal sequence is not strictly necessary 
for rhythm, though in the vast majority of cases it is involved. 
The attention usually passes successively from one complex to 
another, the expectations, the readiness to perceive this rather 
than that, aroused by the one being either satisfied or surprised 
by the other. Surprise plays an equally important part here; 
and the difference in detail between a surprising and delightful 
variation and one which merely irritates and breaks down the 
rhythm, as we say, is here, as elsewhere, a matter of the combination 
and resolution of impulses too subtle for our present means of 
investigation. All depends upon whether what comes can be an 
ingredient in the further response, or whether the mind must, 
as it were, start anew; in more ordinary language, upon whether 
there is any ‘connection’ between the parts of the whole. </p>

<p>But the rhythmic elements in a picture or a building may be not 
successive but simultaneous. A quick reader who sees a word as 
a whole commonly overlooks misprints because the general form 
of the word is such that he is only able at that instant to perceive 
one particular letter in a particular place and so overlooks 
what is discrepant. The parts of a visual field exert what amounts 
to a simultaneous influence over one another. More strictly what 
is discrepant does not get through to more central regions. Similarly, 
with those far more intricate wholes, made up of all kinds of 
imagery and incipient action of which works of art consist. The 
parts of a growing response mutually modify one another and this 
is all that is required for rhythm to be possible. </p>

<br>

<p>We may turn now to that more complex and, more specialised form 
of temporal rhythmic sequence which is known as metre. This is 
the means by which words may be made to influence one another 
to the greatest possible extent. In metrical reading the narrowness 
and definiteness of expectancy, as much unconscious as ever in 
most cases, is very greatly increased, reaching in some cases, 
if rime also is used, almost exact precision. Furthermore, what 
is anticipated becomes through the regularity of the time intervals 
in metre virtually dated. This is no mere matter of more or less 
perfect correspondence with the beating of some internal metronome. 
The whole conception of metre as <i>‘uniformity</i> in variety’, 
a kind of mental drill in which words, those erratic and varied 
things, do their best to behave as though they were all the same, 
with certain concessions, licences and equivalences allowed, 
should nowadays be obsolete. It is a survivor which is still 
able to do a great deal of harm to the uninitiated, however, 
and although it has been knocked on the head vigorously enough 
by Professor Saintsbury and others, it is as difficult to kill 
as Punch. Most treatises on the subject, with their talk of feet 
and of stresses, unfortunately tend to encourage it, however 
little this may be the aim of the authors. </p>

<p>As with rhythm so with metre, we must not think of it as in the 
words themselves or in the thumping of the drum. It is not <i>in</i> 
the stimulation, it is in our response. Metre adds to all the 
variously fated expectancies which make up rhythm a definite 
temporal pattern and its effect is not due to our perceiving 
a pattern in something outside us, but to our becoming patterned 
ourselves. With every beat of the metre a tide of anticipation 
in us turns and swings, setting up as it does so extraordinarily 
extensive sympathetic reverberations. We shall never understand 
metre so long as we ask, ‘Why does: temporal pattern so excite 
us’? and fail to realise that the pattern itself is a vast cyclic 
agitation spreading all over the body, a tide of excitement pouring 
through the channels of the mind. </p>

<p>The notion that there is any virtue in regularity or in variety, 
or in any other formal feature, apart from its effects upon us, 
must be discarded before any metrical problem can be understood. 
The regularity to which metre tends acts through the definiteness 
of the anticipations which are thereby aroused. It is through 
these that it gets such a hold upon the mind. Once again, here 
too, the failure of our expectations is often more important 
than success. Verse in which we constantly get exactly what we 
are ready for and no more, instead of something which we can 
and must take up and incorporate as another stage in a total 
developing response is merely toilsome and tedious. In prose, 
the influence of past words extends only a little way ahead. 
In verse, especially when stanza-form and rime co-operate to 
give a larger unit than the line, it may extend far ahead. It 
is this knitting together of the parts of the poem which explains 
the mnemonic power of verse, the first of the suggestions as 
to the origin of metre to be found in the Fourteenth Chapter 
of <i>Biographia Literaria</i>, that lumber-room of neglected 
wisdom which contains more hints towards a theory of poetry than 
all the rest ever written upon the subject. </p>

<p>We do great violence to the facts if we suppose the expectations 
excited as we read verse to be concerned only with the stress, 
emphasis, length, foot structure and so forth of the syllables 
which follow. Even in this respect the custom of marking syllables 
in two degrees only, long and short, light and full, etc., is 
inadequate, although doubtless forced upon metrists by practical 
considerations. The mind in the poetic experience responds to 
subtler niceties than these. When not in that experience but 
coldly considering their several qualities as sounds by the ear 
alone, it may well find two degrees all that are necessary. In 
Chapter XIII we saw an analogous situation arising in the case 
of the discrimination of colours. The obvious comparison with 
the difference between what even musical notation can record 
in music and the player’s interpretation can usefully be made 
here. </p>

<p>A more serious omission is the neglect by the majority of metrists 
of the pitch relations of syllables. The reading of poetry is 
of course not a monotonous and subdued form of singing. There 
is no question of definite pitches at which the syllables must 
be taken, nor perhaps of definite harmonic relations between 
different sounds. But that a rise and fall of pitch is involved 
in metre and is as much part of the poet’s technique as any other 
feature of verse, as much under his control also, is indisputable. 
Anyone who is not clear upon this point may compare as a striking 
instance Milton’s <i>Hymn on the Morning of Christ’s Nativity</i> 
with Collins’ <i>Ode to Simplicity</i> and both with the second 
Chorus of <i>Hellas</i> discussed in Chapter XXVIII. Due allowances 
made for the natural peculiarities of different readers, the 
scheme of pitch relations, in their contexts, of </p>

<div class="poetry"><p style="padding-left:30%; text-indent:0em; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em">That on the bitter cross <br>
Must redeem our loss; </p></div>

<p class="noindent">and of </p>

<div class="poetry"><p style="padding-left:30%; text-indent:0em; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em">But com’st a decent maid, <br>
In Attic robe array’ɖ, </p></div>

<p class="noindent">are clearly different. There is nothing arbitrary or out of the 
poet’s control in this, as there is nothing arbitrary or out 
of his control in the way in which an adequate reader will stress 
particular syllables. He brings both about by the same means, 
the modification of the reader’s impulses by what has gone before. 
It is true that some words resist emphasis far more than perhaps 
any resist change of pitch, yet this difference is merely one 
of degree. It is as natural to lower the pitch in reading the 
word ‘loss’ as it is to emphasise it as compared with ‘our’ in 
the same context. </p>

<p>Here again we see how impossible it is to consider rhythm or 
metre as though it were purely an affair of the sensory aspect 
of syllables and could be dissociated from their sense and from 
the emotional effects which come about through their sense. One 
principle may, however, be hazarded. As in the case of painting 
the more direct means are preferable to the less direct (see 
Chapter XVIII), so in poetry. What can be done by sound should 
not be done otherwise or in violation of the natural effects 
of sound. Violations of the natural emphases and tones of speech 
brought about for the sake of the further effects due to thought 
and feeling are perilous, though, on occasion, they may be valuable 
devices. The use of italics in <i>Cain</i> to straighten out 
the blank verse is as glaring an instance as any. But more liberties 
are justified in dramatic writing than elsewhere, and poetry 
is full of exceptions to such principles.<a id="note17.2text"></a><a href="#note17.2">*</a> We must not forget 
that Milton did not disdain to use special spelling, ‘mee’, for 
example, in place of ‘me’, in order to suggest additional emphasis 
when he feared that the reader might be careless. </p>

<p>So far we have been concerned with metre only as a specialised 
form of rhythm, giving an increased interconnection between words 
through an increased control of anticipation. But it has other, 
in some cases even more important powers. Its use as an hypnotic 
agent is probably very ancient. Coleridge once again drops his 
incidental remark, just beside yet extremely close to the point. 
“It tends to increase the vivacity and susceptibility both of 
the general feelings and of the attention. This effect it produces 
by the continued excitement of surprise, and by the quick reciprocations 
of curiosity still gratified and still re-excited, which are 
too slight indeed to be at any moment objects of distinct consciousness, 
yet become considerable in their aggregate influence. As a medicated 
atmosphere, or as wine during animated conversation, they act 
powerfully, though themselves unnoticed.” (<i>Biographia Literaria</i>, 
Chap. XVIII.) Mr Yeats, when he speaks of the function of metre 
being to “lull the mind into a waking trance” is describing the 
same effect, however strange his conception of this trance may 
be. </p>

<p>That certain metres, or rather that a certain handling of metre 
should produce in a slight degree a hypnoidal state is not surprising. 
But it does so not as Coleridge suggests, through the surprise 
element in metrical effects, but through the absence of surprise, 
through the lulling effects more than through the awakening. 
Many of the most characteristic symptoms of incipient hypnosis 
are present in a slight degree. Among these susceptibility and 
vivacity of emotion, suggestibility, limitations of the field 
of attention, marked differences in the incidence of belief-feelings 
closely analogous to those which alcohol and nitrous oxide can 
induce, and some degree of hyperæsthesia (increased power of 
discriminating sensations) may be noted. We need not boggle at 
the word ‘hypnosis’. It is sufficient to say, borrowing a phrase 
from M. Jules Romains, that there is a change in the regime of 
consciousness, which is directly due to the metre, and that to 
this regime the above-mentioned characteristics attach. As regards 
the hyperæsthesia, there may be several ways of interpreting 
what can be observed. All that matters here is that syllables, 
which in prose or in <i>vers libres</i> sound thin, tinny and 
flat, often gain an astonishing sonority and fullness even in 
verse which seems to possess no very subtle metrical structure. </p>

<p>Metre has another mode of action not hitherto mentioned. There 
can be little doubt that historically it has been closely associated 
with dancing, and that the connections of the two still hold. 
This is true at least of some ‘measures’. Either motor images, 
images of the sensations of dancing, or, more probably, imaginal 
and incipient movements follow the syllables and make up their 
‘movement’. A place for these accompaniments should be found 
in the diagram in Chapter XVI. Once the metre has begun to ‘catch 
on’ they are almost as closely bound up with the sequence of 
the words as the tied ‘verbal’ images themselves. </p>

<p>The extension of this ‘movement’ of the verse from dance forms 
to more general movements is natural and inevitable. That there 
is a very close connection between the sense and the metrical 
movement of </p>

<div class="poetry"><p style="padding-left:10%; text-indent:0em; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em">And now the numerous tramplings quiver lightly <br>

Wheel downward come they into fresher skies, </p></div>

<p class="noindent">cannot be doubted whatever we may think of the rime. </p>

<p>It is not less clear in </p>

<p class="noindent">Nor is it always the case that the movement takes its cue from 
the sense. It is often a commentary on the sense and sometimes 
may qualify it, as when the resistless strength of Coriolanus 
in battle is given an appearance of dreadful ease by the leisureliness 
of the description, </p>

<div class="poetry"><p style="padding-left:20%; text-indent:0em; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em">Death, that dark spirit, in’s nervy arm doth lie <br>

<p>Movement in poetry deserves at least as much study as onomatopœia. </p>

<p>This account, of course, by no means covers all the ways by which 
metre takes effect in poetry. The fact that we appropriately 
use such words as ‘lulling’, ‘stirring’, ‘solemn’, ‘pensive’, 
‘gay’ in describing metres is an indication of their power more 
directly to control emotion. But the more general effects are 
more important. Through its very appearance of artificiality 
metre produces in the highest degree the ‘frame’ effect, isolating 
the poetic experience from the accidents and irrelevancies of 
everyday existence. We have seen in Chapter X how necessary this 
isolation is and how easily it may be mistaken for a difference 
in kind. Much which in prose would be too personal or too insistent, 
which might awaken irrelevant conjectures or might ‘overstep 
itself’ is managed without disaster in verse. There are, it is 
true, equivalent resources in prose—irony, for example, very 
frequently has this effect—but their scope is far more limited. 
Metre for the most difficult and most delicate utterances is 
the all but inevitable means. </p>

</div></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> diagram and account given of the processes which make up 
the reading of a poem may be easily modified to represent what 
happens when we look at a picture, a statue or building, or listen 
to a piece of music. The necessary changes are fairly obvious, 
and it will only be necessary here to indicate them briefly. 
Needless to say the importance to the whole response of different 
kinds of elements varies enormously from art to art; so much 
so as to explain without difficulty the opinion so often held 
by persons interested primarily in one of the arts—that the others 
(or some of them) are entirely different in nature. Thus painters 
often aver that poetry is so different, so indirect, so second-hand 
in the way in which it produces its results, as hardly to deserve 
the name of an art at all. But, as we shall see, the differences 
between separate arts are sometimes no greater than differences 
to be found in each of them; and close analogies can be discovered 
by careful analysis between all of them. These analogies indeed 
are among the most interesting features which such scrutiny as 
we are here attempting can make clear. For an understanding of 
the problems of one art is often of great service in avoiding 
misconceptions in another. The place of representation in painting, 
for example, is greatly elucidated by a sound comprehension of 
the place of reference or thought in poetry, just as a crude 
view on this latter point is likely to involve unfortunate mistakes 
upon the first. Similarly a too narrow view of music which would 
limit it to an affair merely of the appreciation of the pitch 
and time relations of notes may be corrected most easily by a 
comparison with the phenomena of colour in the plastic arts. 
Comparison of the arts is, in fact, far the best means by which 
an understanding of the methods and resources of any one of them 
can be attained. We must be careful of course not to compare 
the wrong features of two arts and not to find merely fanciful 
or insecurely grounded analogies. The dangers both of too close 
assimilation and too wide separation of the structures of different 
arts are well illustrated in criticism, both before and since 
the days of Lessing. Only a thorough psychological analysis will 
allow them to be avoided, and those whose experience leads them 
to doubt whether analogies are of service, may be asked whether 
their objection is not directed merely to attempts to compare 
different arts without a sufficient analysis. With such an analysis, 
comparison and the elaboration of analogies involve no attempt 
to make one art legislate for another, no attempt to blur their 
differences or to destroy their autonomy. </p>

<p>In analysing the experiences of the visual arts the first essential 
is to avoid the word ‘see’, a term which is treacherous in its 
ambiguity. If we say that we see a picture we may mean either 
that we see the pigment-covered surface, or that we see the image 
on the retina cast by this surface, or that we see certain planes 
or volumes in what is called the ‘picture-space’. These senses 
are completely distinct. In the first case we are speaking of 
the source of the stimulus, in the second of the immediate effect 
of the stimulus on the retina, in the third we are referring 
to a complex response made up of perceivings and imaginings due 
to the intervention of mental structures left behind by past 
experience, and excited by the stimulus. The first case we may 
leave out of account as a matter of purely technical interest. 
The degree of similarity holding between the second and third, 
between the first effect of the stimulus and the whole visual 
response, will of course vary greatly in different cases. A perfectly 
flat, meticulously detailed depiction of conventionally conceived 
objects, such as is so often praised in the Academy for its ‘finish’, 
may be very nearly the same from its first impression on the 
retina to the last effort which vision can make upon it. At the 
other extreme a Cézanne, for example, which to the eye of a person 
quite unfamiliar with such a manner of painting may at first 
seem only a field or area of varied light, may, as the response 
develops, through repeated glances, become first an assemblage 
of blots and patches of colour, and then, as these recede and 
advance, tilt and spread relatively to one another and become 
articulated, a system of volumes. Finally, as the distances and 
stresses of their volumes become more definitely imagined, it 
becomes an organisation of the entire ‘picture-space’ into a 
three-dimensional whole with the characters of the solid masses 
which appear in it, their weights, textures, tensions and what 
not, very definitely, as it seems, given. With familiarity the 
response is of course shortened. Its final visual stage is reached 
much sooner, and the stages outlined above become, through this 
telescoping, too fleeting to be noticed. None the less the great 
difference between the first retinal impression and the complete 
<i>visual</i> response remains. The retinal impression, the sign, 
that is, for the response, contains actually but a small part 
of the whole final product, an all-important part it is true, 
the seed in fact from which the whole response grows. </p>

<p>The additions made in the course of the response are of several 
kinds. They may, perhaps, for our present purposes be spoken 
of without misunderstanding as images, or image-substitutes (see 
Chapter XVI). The eye, as is well known, is peculiar among our 
sense organs in that the receptor, the retina, is a part of the 
brain, instead of being a separate thing connected with the brain 
more or less remotely by a peripheral nerve. Moreover there are 
certain connections leading from other parts of the brain outwards 
to the retina as well as connections leading inwards. Thus there 
is some ground for supposing that through these outgoing connections 
actual retinal effects may accompany some visual images, which 
would thereby become much more like actual sensations than is 
the case with the other senses. However this may be, the process 
whereby an impression which, if interpreted in one way (e.g. 
by a person measuring the pigmented areas of a canvas), is correctly 
counted as a sign of a flat coloured surface, becomes, when differently 
interpreted, an intricately divided three-dimensional space—this 
process is one of the intervention of images of several kinds. </p>

<p>The order of these interventions probably varies from case to 
case. Perhaps the most important of the images which come in 
to give depth, volume, solidity to the partly imagined and partly 
perceived ‘picture-space’ are those which are relicts of eye 
movements, kinæsthetic images of the convergence of the eyes 
and accommodation of the lenses according to the distance of 
the object contemplated. When, as it seems, we look past an object 
in a picture to some more distant object, seeming in so doing 
to change the focus of our eyes, we do not as a rule actually 
make any change. But certainly we feel as though we were focussing 
differently and as though the convergence were different. This 
felt difference which mainly gives the sense of greater distance 
is due to kinæsthetic imagery. Correspondingly the parts of the 
‘picture-space’ upon which we seem to be focussing, upon which 
we <i>are</i> imaginally focussing, become definite and distinct, 
and parts much nearer or much more distant become to some extent 
blurred and diffused. This effect is probably due to visual images, 
simulating the sensations which would normally ensue were we 
actually making a change of focus. The degree to which these 
last effects occur appears to differ very greatly from one person 
to another. Insufficient attention to the great variation in 
the means by which these images are involved by the painting 
is responsible for much bad criticism. Thus artists can commonly 
be found who are quite unable, when looking at paintings: in 
which the means employed are unlike their own, to apprehend forms 
over which less specialised persons find no difficulty. In general 
most visitors to Galleries pay too little attention to the fact 
that few pictures can be instantaneously apprehended, that even 
ten minutes’ study is quite inadequate in the case of unfamiliar 
kinds of work, and that the capacity for ‘seeing’ pictures (in 
sense three), an indispensable but merely an initial step to 
appreciating them, is something which has to be acquired. It 
is naturally of great assistance if many works by the same painter 
or of the same School can be seen together, for then the essential 
methods employed become clearer. In a general collection it is 
difficult not to look at too great a variety of pictures, and 
a confusion results, perhaps unnoticed, which is a serious obstacle 
to the coherent building up of any one picture. The fashion in 
which most Old Masters are hidden away under grime and glass 
and the efforts which are necessary in order to reconstruct them 
are additional obstacles. The neglect of these obvious facts 
is the chief explanation of the low level of appreciation and 
criticism from which the art of painting at present suffers. </p>

<p>Following upon the visual images are a swarm of others varying 
from picture to picture: tactile images giving the appearance 
of texture to surfaces, muscular images giving hardness, stiffness, 
softness, flexibility and so on to the volumes imagined—the lightness 
and insubstantiality of muslin, the solidity and fixity of rock 
being matters of the intervention of images due originally to 
the sensations we have received in the past from these materials. 
This muscular imagery is of course called up in differing ways 
in different cases. Primarily it is due to the imitation by the 
artist of subtleties in the light given off by the materials, 
or characteristic peculiarities in their form, but there are, 
as we shall see, more indirect but also less stable, less reliable 
and less efficacious ways by which they may be evoked. The same 
applies to the other images, thermal, olfactory, auditory and 
the rest, which may be involved in particular cases. There is 
a direct and an indirect way in which they can be evoked. They 
may spring up at the visual appeal or they may only respond at 
a later stage as a result of roundabout trains of thinking. Thus 
a silk scarf may <i>look</i> soft and light; or we may imagine 
it as light, it <i>looking</i> all the while iron-hard and heavy, 
because we know that it is a scarf and that scarves are soft 
and light. The two methods are very different. The second is 
a reversal of the natural order of perception and for this reason 
the condemnation so often heard from painters, of the literary 
or ‘detective’ approach to pictures, of which this would be a 
representative specimen, is well merited. We must, however, distinguish 
cases in which there is this reversal from those in which it 
does not occur, those namely in which by a process of inference 
we arrive at conclusions about the represented objects which 
could not possibly be directly given. But this question may be 
deferred until we come to discuss representation. </p>

<p>Hitherto in considering the growth of the three-dimensional imagined 
picture-space we have not explicitly mentioned the part played 
by colour nor the equally important effect of this growth in 
modifying the original colours of the first retinal impression. 
But not only may colour be the chief factor determining form, 
i.e. the three-dimensional organisation of space, but it is itself 
most vitally modified by form. </p>

<p>Colours as signs, that is to say even at the most optical and 
least elaborated stage, have certain very marked spatial characters 
of their own. Red, for example, seems to advance towards the 
eye and to swell out of its boundaries, while blue seems to retreat 
and to withdraw into itself<a id="note18.1text"></a><a href="#note18.1">*</a>. Degree of saturation may also 
give recession in obvious and in more recondite ways. Pure colours 
in the foreground and greyed colours in the background are a 
simple example. Similarly opposition of colours is one of the 
main means by which the stresses and strains of volumes may be 
suggested. </p>

<p>These characters of colours, especially when they reinforce and 
co-operate with one another, may be made to play a very important 
part in determining the way in which the picture-space is constructed 
when we look at a picture. </p>

<p>Equally important are the less direct effects upon our picture-space 
imagining of the emotional or organic responses which we make 
to different colours. Individuals vary greatly in the extent 
to which they notice and can reflectively distinguish these responses, 
and probably also in the degree to which they actually make different 
responses. To persons sensitive in this respect, the colours 
excite each a distinct, well-marked emotion (and attitude) capable 
of being clearly differentiated from others. The sad poverty 
and vagueness of the colour vocabulary, however, misleads many 
people with regard to these. Each of the ‘puces’, ‘mauves’, ‘magentas’ 
etc. has to cover numbers of distinguishable colours, often with 
strikingly different effects upon us. Thus people who are content 
to say that pink is their favourite colour, or that green always 
suits them, are either quite undiscriminating in their attitude 
towards colour or little attentive to the actual effects produced 
upon them. A similar obtuseness or insincerity is evidenced when 
it is maintained, as is often done, that pink and green do not 
go together. Some pinks and some greens do not, but some do, 
and the test of a colourist is just his ability to feel which 
are which. Few if any, in fact, of the colour relations with 
which the painter is concerned can be stated with the aid of 
such general terms—‘red’, ‘brown’, ‘yellow’, ‘grey’, ‘primrose’, 
etc.—as are at present available. Each of these stands for a 
number of different colours whose relations to a given colour 
will commonly be different. </p>

<p>Taking ‘colour’ in this sense to stand for specific colours, 
not for classes or ranges of varying hues, sets of colours, where 
in certain spatial proportions and in certain relations of saturation, 
brightness and luminosity relatively to one another, excite responses 
of emotion and attitude with marked individual characteristics. 
Colours, in fact, have harmonic relations, although the physical 
laws governing these relations are at present unknown, and the 
relations themselves only imperfectly ascertained. For every 
colour another can be found such that the combined response to 
the two will be of a recognisable kind, whose peculiarities are 
due probably to the compatibility with one another of the impulses 
set up by each. This compatibility varies in a number of ways. 
The result is that for every colour a set of other colours is 
discoverable such that the response to each of them is compatible 
with the response to the tonic colour in a definite way.<a id="note18.2text"></a><a href="#note18.2">*</a> A 
sensitive colourist feels these compatibilities as giving to 
these combinations of colours a definite character, which no 
other combinations possess. Similarly relations of incompatibility 
between colours can also be felt such that their combination 
yields no ordered response but merely a clash and confusion of 
responses. Colours which just fail to be complementary are a 
typical example. Similarly the primary colours in combination 
are offensive; should this precise kind of offensiveness be part 
of the artist’s purpose, he will, of course, make use of them. </p>

<p>The fact that roses, sunsets, and so forth are so often found 
to present harmonious combinations of colour may appear a little 
puzzling by this account. But the vast range of close gradations, 
which a rose petal, for example, presents, supplies the explanation. 
Out of all these the eye picks that gradation which best accords 
with the other colours chosen. There is usually some set of colours 
in some harmonious relation to one another to be selected out 
of the multitudinous gradations which natural objects in most 
lightings present; and there are evident reasons why the eye 
of a sensitive person should, when it can, pick out those gradations 
which best accord. The great range of different possible selections 
is, however, of importance. It explains the fact that we see 
such different colours for instance when gloomy and when gay, 
and thus how the actual selection made by an artist may reveal 
the kind and direction of the impulses which are active in him 
at the moment of selection. </p>

<p>Needless to say in the absence of a clear nomenclature and standardisation 
of colours the task of describing and recording colour relations 
is of great difficulty, but the unanimity of competent, that 
is, sensitive persons as to which colours are related in specific 
ways to which, is too great to be disregarded. It is as great 
as the unanimity among musicians as to the harmonic relations 
of notes to one another. The great differences between the two 
cases are not likely to be overlooked. The presence of physical 
laws in many cases connecting notes harmonically related and 
the absence of similar known physical laws connecting colours 
is a glaring difference. But it should not be forgotten that 
these physical laws are, as it were, an extra-musical piece of 
knowledge. What matters to the musician is not the physical connections 
between notes but the compatibilities and incompatibilities in 
the responses of emotion and attitude which they excite. The 
musical relations between the notes would be the same even though 
the physical relations between the stimuli which arouse them 
were quite different. </p>

<p>Naturally enough the analogy with the harmonic relations of music 
has been the chief guide to those who have systematically investigated 
colour relations. Whatever may be the precise limits to which 
it may profitably be carried, for anyone who wishes to form a 
general conception of the emotional effects of colours in combination 
it is of very great value. </p>

<p>Colour is of course primarily the cause and controlling factor 
of emotional response to painting, but, as we have said, it may, 
and commonly does, help to determine form. Parts of a picture 
which are through their colour out of all emotional connection 
with the rest of the picture, tend, other things being equal, 
to fall out of the picture altogether, appearing as patches accidentally 
adhering to the surface or as gaps through which something else 
irrelevant is seen. This is the extreme instance, but the influence 
of colour upon form through the emotional relations of colours 
to one another is all-pervading Sometimes colour strengthens 
and solidifies the structure, sometimes it fights against it, 
sometimes it turns into a commentary, as it were, the colour 
response modifying the form response and <i>vice versa</i>. The 
great complexity of the colour and form interactions needs no 
insistence. They are so various that no rule can possibly be 
laid down as to a <i>right</i> relation for all cases. All depends 
upon what the whole response which the painter is seeking to 
record may be. As with attempts to define a universal proper 
relation of rhythm to thought in poetry (e.g. the assertion that 
rhythm should echo or correspond to thought, etc.), so with general 
remarks as to how form and colour should be related. All depends 
upon the purpose, the total response to which both form and colour 
are merely means. Mistakes between means and ends, glorifying 
particular techniques into inexplicable virtues are at least 
as common in the criticism of painting as with any other of the 
arts. </p>

<p>One other aspect of the picture-space needs consideration. It 
is not necessarily a fixed and static construction, but may in 
several ways contain elements of movement. Some of these may 
be eye movements, or kinæsthetic images of eye movements. As 
the eye wanders imaginally from point to point the relations 
between the parts of the picture-space change; thus an effect 
of movement is induced. Equally important are the fusions of 
successive visual images which may be suggested by drawing. As 
we watch, for example, an arm being flexed, the eye receives 
a series of successive and changing retinal impressions. Certain 
combinations of these, which represent not the position and form 
of the arm at any instant, but a compromise or fusion of different 
positions and forms, have an easily explicable capacity to represent 
the whole series, and thus to represent movement. The use of 
such fused images in drawing may easily be mistaken for distortion, 
but when properly interpreted it may yield normal forms in movement. 
Many other means by which movement is given in Painting might 
be mentioned. One means by which colour, may suggest it, for 
example, is well indicated in the following description by Signac 
of <i>Muley-abd-er Rahman entouré de sa garde</i>: “la tumulte 
est traduit par l’accord presque dissonant du grand parasol vert 
sur le bleu du ciel, surexcité déjà par l’orangé des murailles<a id="note18.3text"></a><a href="#note18.3">†</a>”. 
It need hardly be pointed out that the response made to the picture-space 
varies enormously according to whether the forms in it are seen 
as in rest or in movement. </p>

<br>

<p>So far we have merely discussed what may be described as the 
sensory elements in the picture, and the responses in emotion 
and attitude due to these elements. But in most painting there 
are further elements essentially involved. It has been asserted 
that all further elements are irrelevant, at least to appreciation; 
and as a reaction to common views that seem to overlook the sensory 
elements altogether the doctrine is comprehensible and perhaps 
not without value. For too many people do look at pictures primarily 
with intent to discover what they are ‘of’, what they represent, 
without allowing the most important thing in the picture, its 
sensory stimulation through colour and form, to take effect. 
But the reaction goes too far when it denies the relevance of 
the representative elements in all cases. It may be freely granted 
that there are great pictures in which nothing is represented, 
and great pictures in which what is represented is trivial and 
may be disregarded. It is equally certain that there are great 
pictures in which the contribution to the whole response made 
through representation is not less than that made more directly 
through form and colour. To those who can accept the general 
psychological standpoint already outlined, or indeed any modern 
account of the working of the mind, the assertion that there 
is no reason why representative and formal factors in an experience 
should conflict, but much reason why they should co-operate, 
will need no discussion. The psychology of ‘unique æsthetic emotions’ 
and ‘pure art values’ upon which the contrary view relies is 
merely a caprice of the fancy. </p>

<p>The place of representation in the work o different masters varies 
enormously and it is not true that the value of their works varies 
correspondingly. From Raphael and Picasso at one extreme to Rembrandt, 
Goya and Hogarth at the other, Rubens, Delacroix and Giotto occupying 
an intermediate position, all degrees of participation between 
non-representative form and represented subject in the building 
up of the whole response can be found. We may perhaps hazard, 
for reasons indicated already, as a principle admitting of exception, 
that what can be done by sensory means should not be done indirectly 
through representation. But to say more than this is to give 
yet another instance of the commonest of critical mistakes: the 
exaltation of a method into an end. </p>

<p>Representation in painting corresponds to thought in poetry. 
The same battles over the Intellect-Emotion <i>imbroglio</i> 
rage in both fields. The views recently so fashionable that representation 
has no place in art and that treatment not subject is what matters 
in poetry spring ultimately from the same mistakes as to the 
relation of thinking to feeling, from an inadequate psychology 
which would set up one as inimical to the other. Reinforced as 
they are by the illusion, supported by language, that Beauty 
is a quality of things, not a character of our response to them, 
and thus that all beautiful things as sharing this Beauty must 
be alike, the confusion which such views promote is a main cause 
of the difficulty which is felt so widely in appreciating both 
the arts and poetry. They give an air of an esoteric mystery 
to what is, if it can be done at all, the simplest and most natural 
of proceedings. </p>

<p>The fundamental features of the experiences of reading poetry 
and of appreciating pictures, the features upon which their value 
depends, are alike. The means by which they are brought about 
are unlike, but closely analogous critical and technical problems 
arise, as we have seen, for each. The misapprehensions to which 
thought is liable recur in all the fields in which it is exercised, 
and the fact that it is sometimes more easy to detect a mistake 
in one field than in another is a strong argument for comparing 
such closely allied subjects. </p>

<span class="smcap">Sculpture and the Construction of Form</span></h2>
<div class="epigraph"><div class="poetry">
<p style="text-indent:0em; padding-left:10%">Thus men forgot <br>
That All Deities reside in the Human breast. </p>
<p style="text-align:right; padding-right:10%"><i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>. </p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> initial signs from which the work of art is built up psychologically 
in the case of sculpture differ in several respects from the 
initial signs of painting. There are of course forms of sculpture 
for which the difference is slight. Some bas-reliefs, for example, 
can be considered as essentially drawings, and sculpture placed 
as a decorative detail in architecture so that it can only be 
viewed from one angle has necessarily to be interpreted in much 
the same manner. Similarly some primitive sculpture in which 
only one aspect is represented may be considered as covered by 
what has been said about painting, although the fact that the 
relief and the relation of volumes is more completely given and 
less supplied by imaginative effort is of some consequence. Further, 
the changes, slight though they may be, which accompany slight 
movements of the contemplator have their effect. His total attitude 
is altered in a way which may or may not be important according 
to circumstances. </p>

<p>With sculpture in which a number (four for example) of aspects 
are fully treated without any attempt to fill in the intermediate 
connecting aspects, the whole state of affairs is changed, since 
there arises the interpretative task of uniting these aspects 
into a whole. </p>

<p>This connection of a number of aspects into a whole may be made 
in varying ways. The signs may receive a <i>visual</i> interpretation 
and the form be mainly built up of visual images combined in 
sequences or fused. This, however, is an unsatisfactory method. 
It tends to leave out or blur too many of the possible responses 
to the statue and there is usually something unstable about such 
syntheses. The form so constructed is insubstantial and incomplete. 
Thus those sculptors whose work primarily asks for such a visual 
interpretation are commonly felt to be lacking in what is called 
a ‘sense of form’. The reasons for this are to be found in the 
nature of visual imagery and in the necessarily limited character 
of our purely visual awareness of space. </p>

<p>But the connection may be made, not through visual combination, 
but through combination of the various muscular images whereby 
we feel, or imaginatively construct the tensions, weights, stresses, 
etc. of physical objects. Each sequence of visual impressions 
as we look at the statue from varying standpoints calls up a 
group of these muscular images, and these images are capable 
of much more subtle and stable combinations than the corresponding 
visual images. Thus two visual images which are incompatible 
with one another may be each accompanied by muscular images (feelings 
of stress, tension, etc.) which are perfectly compatible and 
unite to form a coherent whole free from conflict. By this means 
we may realise the solidity of forms far more perfectly than 
if we rely upon visual resources alone, and since it is mainly 
through the character of the statue as a solid that the sculptor 
works, this muscular interpretation has, as a rule, obvious and 
overwhelming advantages. </p>

<p>None the less a place remains for sculpture whose primary interpretation 
is in visual terms. Looking at any of the more recent work of 
Epstein, for example, a feeling of quick and active intelligence 
on the part of the contemplator arises, and this sense of his 
own activity is the source of much that follows in his response. 
By contrast a work of Rodin seems to be not so much exciting 
activity in him as active itself. The correlation of visual aspects, 
in other words, is a conscious process compared with the automatic 
correlation of muscular image responses. The first we seem to 
be doing ourselves, the second seems to be something which belongs 
to the statue. This difference as we have described it is of 
course a technical difference and by itself involves nothing 
as to the value of the different works concerned. A similar difference 
may be found in the apprehension of form in painting. </p>

<p>These two modes are not as separate as our account would suggest; 
neither occurs in purity. Their interaction is further complicated 
through the highly representational character of most sculpture, 
and through the interlinking of different interpretations due 
to the congruences and incompatibilities of the emotional responses 
to which they give rise. </p>

<p>With sculpture perhaps more than with any other of the plastic 
arts we are in danger of overlooking the work of the contemplator’s 
imagination in filling out and interpreting the sign. What we 
transport from Egypt to London is merely a set of signs, from 
which a suitable interpreter setting about it rightly can produce 
a certain state of mind. It is this state of mind which matters 
and which gives its value to the statue. But so obscure to ordinary 
introspection are the processes of the interpretation that we 
tend to think that none occur. That we interpret a picture or 
a poem is obvious upon very little reflection. That we interpret 
a mass of marble is less obvious. The historical accident that 
speculation upon Beauty largely developed in connection with 
sculpture is responsible in great degree for the fixity of the 
opinion that Beauty is something inherent in physical objects, 
not a character of some of our responses to objects. </p>

<p>From certain visual signs, then, the contemplator constructs, 
muscularly as well as visually, the spatial form of the statue. 
We have seen that the picture-space is a construction, similarly 
the statue-space is a construction, and the proportions and relations 
of the volumes which in this statue-space make up the statue 
are by no means necessarily the same as those of the mass of 
marble from which we receive our signs. In other words, the scientific 
examination of the statue and the imaginative contemplation of 
it do not yield the same spatial results. Thus the process of 
measuring<a id="note19.1text"></a><a href="#note19.1">*</a> statues with a view to discovering a numerical formula 
for Beauty is little likely to be fruitful. And the work of those, 
such as Havard Thomas, who have attempted to use this method, 
show the features which we should expect. Their merits derive 
from factors outside the range of the theory. The psychological 
processes involved in the construction of space are too subtle, 
and the differences between the actual configuration of the marble 
and the configuration of the statue in the statue-space are brought 
about in too many ways for any correlation to be established. </p>

<p>Among the factors which intervene in the building up of the imaginative 
form the most obvious are the lighting, and the material.  </p>

<p>With change of lighting, change of form follows at once through 
change in the visual signs, and since stone is often a translucent 
not an opaque material, lighting is by no means such a simple 
matter as is sometimes supposed. More is involved than the avoidance 
of distracting cast shadows and the disposal of the brightest 
illumination upon the right portions of the statue. The general 
aim should obviously be to reproduce the lighting for which the 
sculptor designed his work, an aim which requires very sensitive 
and full appreciation for its success. An aim, moreover, which 
in the case of works transported from North to South and <i>vice 
versa</i> is sometimes impossible of realisation. </p>

<p>The interpretation of form is an extraordinarily complex affair. 
The consequences of the asymmetricality of space as we construct 
it must be noted. Up and down have distinct characters which 
differ from those of right and left, which differ again from 
those of away and towards us. A measured vertical distance does 
not seem to us the same as an equal horizontal distance. Nor 
does a equal distance away from us seem equal to either. These 
effects are modified again, sometimes reinforced, sometimes reduced, 
by effects due to quite a different source, to the relative ease 
or difficulty with which the eye follows certain lines. The greater 
and less compatibility of certain eye movements with others is 
the cause of much of what is confusedly called Rhythm in the 
plastic arts. After certain lines we expect others, and the success 
or failure of our expectation modifies our response. Unexpectedness, 
of course, is an obvious technical resource for the artist. The 
intervention here of the representational factor cannot be overlooked. 
An eye movement which encounters difficulty for any of a number 
of possible reasons, among which so-called rhythmical factors 
deserve special notice, is interpreted as standing for a greater 
distance than an equal but more easy movement. This is only a 
rough rule, for yet other psychological factors may come in to 
nullify or even reverse the effect; for example, an explicit 
recognition of the difficulty. Yet another determining condition 
in our estimation of intervals of space is the uniformity of 
their filling. Thus a line one inch long hatched across will 
generally seem longer than an equal line unhatched, and a modulated 
surface seem larger than a smooth one. </p>

<p>These instances of the psychological factors which help to make 
the imaginatively constructed statue-space different from the 
actual space occupied by the marble will be enough to show how 
intricate is the interpretation by which we take even the first 
step towards the appreciation of a statue. Our full response 
of attitude and emotion is entirely dependent upon how we perform 
the initial operations. It is of course impossible to make these 
interpretations separately, consciously and deliberately. Neural 
arrangements over which we have little or no direct control perform 
them for us. Thanks to their complexity the resultant effect, 
the imagined form of the statue, will vary greatly from individual 
to individual and in the same individual from time to time. It 
might be thought therefore that the hope that a statue will be 
a vehicle of the same experience for many different individuals 
is vain. Certain simplifications, however, save the situation. </p>

<p>Form, we have seen, is, through our selection among the possible 
signs present, within certain limits what we like to make it. 
As it varies, so do our further or deeper responses of feeling 
and attitude vary. But just as there are congruences and compatibilities 
among the responses we make, in the case of colour, which tend, 
given certain colours, to make us pick out of a range of possible 
colours one which will give us a congruent (or harmonious) response, 
so it is with form. Out of the multitude of different forms which 
we might construct by stressing certain of the signs rather than 
others, the fixing even temporarily of a part of the form tends 
to bias us towards so interpreting the rest as to yield responses 
accordant with those already active. Hence a great reduction 
of the disparity of the interpretations which arise, hence also 
the danger of an initial misapprehension which perverts the rest 
of the interpretation. </p>

<br>

<p>This Chapter, like the last, is intended as an indication, merely, 
of the ways in which a psychological analysis may assist the 
critic and help to remove misconceptions. The usual practice 
of alluding to Form as though it were a simple unanalysable virtue 
of objects—a procedure most discouraging to those who like to 
know what they are doing, and thus very detrimental to general 
appreciation—will lapse when a better understanding of the situation 
becomes general. None the less there are certain very puzzling 
facts as to the effects of forms when apprehended which in part 
explain this way of talking. These are perhaps best considered 
in connection with Music, the most purely formal of the arts. </p>

<span class="smcap">The <i>Impasse</i> of Musical Theory</span> </h2>
<div class ="epigraph"><div class="poetry">
<p style="text-indent: 0%; padding-left:10%">Will twenty chapters render plain <br>
Those lonely lights that still remain <br>
Just breaking over land and main? </p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">For</span> fairly obvious reasons the psychology of Music is often regarded 
as more backward than that of the other arts, and the <i>impasse</i> 
which has here been reached more baffling and more exasperating. 
But such advance as has been possible in the theory of the other 
arts has been mainly concerned with them as representational 
or as serviceable. For poetry, for painting, for architecture 
there still remain problems as perplexing as any which can be 
raised about music. For example, what is the difference between 
good and bad blank verse in its formal aspect, between delightful 
and distressing alliteration, between euphony and cacophony, 
between metrical triumph and metrical failure? Or in the case 
of Painting, why do certain forms excite such marked responses 
of emotion and attitude and others, so very like them geometrically, 
excite none or produce merely confusion? Why have colours their 
specific responses and how is it that their combinations have 
such subtle and yet definite effects? Or what is the reason that 
spaces and volumes in Architecture affect us as they do? These 
questions are at present as much without answers as any that 
we can raise about Music; but the fact that in these arts other 
questions arise which can in part be answered, whereas in Music 
questions about the effects of form overwhelmingly preponderate, 
has in part obscured the situation. </p>

<p>Other effects are of course also involved; in programme music 
something analogous to representation in painting; in opera and 
much other music, dramatic action; and so forth. But these effects, 
although often contributing to the total value, are plainly subordinate 
in music to its more direct influence as sound alone. The difficulties 
which they raise have such close analogies in painting and poetry 
that a separate discussion may be omitted. The problem of ‘pure 
form’ arises, however, with peculiar insistence in music. </p>

<p>More than forty years ago Gurney summed up the state of musical 
theory as follows: “When we come to actual forms, and to the 
startling differences of merit which the very simplest known 
to us present, the musical faculty defies all explanation of 
its action and its judgements. The only conceivable explanation 
indeed would be an analogy, and we know not where to look for 
it<a id="note20.1text"></a><a href="#note20.1">†</a>”. And the work done since has added remarkably little. 
As he so admirably insisted, even though we confine ourselves 
to the responses of one individual, all general explanations 
of the musical effect apply equally to the ineffective, to the 
distressing and the delightful, to the admirable and the atrocious 
alike. But the same is true of all attempts to explain the effects 
upon us of any forms which neither represent something nor are 
in obvious ways serviceable. Whether they are forms seen or heard, 
whether they are made up of notes or of movements, of intervals 
of time or of images of speech, the same is true of them all. </p>

<p>Whatever effects cannot be traced to some practical use we might 
make of them (as we use a plate to eat from or a house to live 
in), or to some interference with or threat against the ways 
in which we might act, or to some object practically interesting 
to us, which they represent—all such effects are necessarily 
very difficult to explain. </p>

<p>There is nothing in the least mysterious, however, about the 
difficulty of explaining them. The facts required happen to be 
beyond our present powers of observation. They belong to a branch 
of psychology for which we have as yet no methods of investigation. 
It seems likely that we shall have to wait a long while, and 
that very great advances must first be made in neurology before 
these problems can profitably be attacked. But however regrettable 
this may be, there is no justification whatever for the invention 
of unique faculties and ultimate, analysable, indefinable entities. 
To say that a thing is unanalysable may be to assert either that 
it is simple or that we do not know yet how to analyse it. Musical 
effects, like the effects of forms in general, are inexplicable 
in the second sense only. To pretend that they are inexplicable 
in the first sense is mere mystery-mongering. To take two parallel 
cases, trade booms and fine weather were until recently inexplicable, 
and are doubtless still in many respects difficult to account 
for. But no one would pretend that these blessings require us 
to assume unique <i>sui generis</i> tendencies in economic or 
meteorological affairs. </p>

<p>But the practice of describing the ‘musical faculty’ and the 
formal effects of the arts in general as <i>sui generis</i> has 
another cause in addition to intellectual bewilderment. Many 
people think that to say that a mental activity is unique, or 
<i>sui generis</i>, in some way gives it a more exalted standing 
than if it were recognised as merely too complicated or too inaccessible 
to experiment to be at present explained. In part this is a relic 
of the old opinion that explanation is itself derogatory, an 
opinion which only those who are, in this respect, uneducated, 
still entertain. Partly also this preference for ‘unique’ things 
is due to confusion with the sense in which St Paul’s may be 
said to be unique. But the experience of ‘seeing stars’ after 
a bang on the nose is just as ‘unique’ as any act of musical 
appreciation and shares any exalted quality which such uniqueness 
may be supposed to confer. </p>

<p>Every element in a form, whether it be a musical form or any 
other, is capable of exciting a very intricate and widespread 
response. Usually the response is of a minimal order and escapes 
introspection. Thus a single note or a uniform colour has for 
most people hardly any observable effect beyond its sensory characteristics. 
When it occurs along with other elements the form which they 
together make up may have striking consequences in emotion and 
attitude. If we regard this as an affair of mere summation of 
effects it may seem impossible that the effect of the form can 
be the result of the effects of the elements, and thus it is 
natural and easy to invent ultimate properties of ‘forms’ by 
way of pseudo-explanation. But a little more psychological insight 
makes these inventions appear quite unnecessary. The effects 
of happenings in the mind rarely add themselves up. Our more 
intense experiences are not built up of less intense experiences 
as a wall is built up of bricks. The metaphor of addition is 
utterly misleading. That of the resolution of forces would be 
better, but even this does not adequately represent the behaviour 
of the mind. The separate responses which each element in isolation 
would tend to excite are so connected with one another that their 
combination is, for our present knowledge, incalculable in its 
effects. Two stimuli which, when separated by one interval of 
time or space, would merely cancel one another, with another 
interval produce an effect which is far beyond anything which 
either alone could produce. And the combined response when they 
are suitably arranged may be of quite another kind than that 
of either. We may, if we like, think of the effects of impulses 
at various intervals of time upon a pendulum, but this metaphor 
is, as we have suggested, insufficient. It is over simple. The 
intricacies of chemical reactions come nearer to being what we 
need. The great quantities of latent energy which may be released 
by quite slight changes in conditions suggest better what happens 
when stimuli are combined. But even this metaphor incompletely 
represents the complexity of the interactions in the nervous 
system. It is only by conjecture that its working can as yet 
be divined. What is certain is chat it is the most complex and 
the most sensitive thing of which we know. </p>

<p>The unpredicable and miraculous differences, then, in the total 
responses which slight changes in the arrangement of stimuli 
produce, can be fully accounted for in terms of the sensitiveness 
of the nervous system; and the mysteries of ‘forms’ are merely 
a consequence of our present ignorance of the detail of its action. 
We have spoken above of the ‘elements’ of a form, but in fact 
we do not yet know which these are. Any musical sound, for example, 
is plainly complex, though how complex it is from the point of 
view of its musical effects is still very uncertain. It has pitch, 
it has <i>timbre</i>, the characters which change as it is played 
upon one kind of instrument or another, the characters which 
are sometimes called its colour. Its effects also vary with its 
loudness and with its volume. It may be far more complex still. 
Its relations again to other musical sounds may be of at least 
three kinds: pitch relations, harmonic relations and temporal 
relations, complicated, all of them, in the utmost degree by 
Rhythm. Possibly other relations still are involved. There would 
be no advantage here in entering into the detail of the analysis 
of these qualities and relations. The one point of importance 
for our present purpose is the immense scope for the resolution, 
interinanimation, conflict and equilibrium of impulses opened 
up by this extraordinary complexity of musical sounds and of 
their possible arrangement. It is not in the least surprising 
that so few invariable correspondences between stimuli and total 
responses have as yet been discovered. </p>

<p>The same state of affairs recurs wherever forms by themselves, 
dissociated from all practical uses and from all representation 
produce immediate effects upon the mind. In painting, in sculpture, 
in architecture and in poetry, we need equally to be on our guard 
against those who would attribute peculiar, unique and mystic 
virtues to forms in themselves. In every case their effect is 
due to the interplay (not the addition) of the effects which 
their elements excite. Especially we do well to beware of empty 
speculations upon ‘necessary and inevitable relations’ as the 
source of the effect. Of course in a given case a certain relation, 
a certain arrangement, may be necessary, in the sense that the 
elements if differently disposed would have a quite different 
combined effect. But this is not the sense in which necessity 
is usually claimed. It is necessity, in the metaphysical sense, 
some here utterly obscure kind of ‘logical necessity’ which is 
the favourite toy of a number of art critics. To those who have 
some familiarity both with Logic and with Psychology the regular 
appearance of the term ‘logical’ in describing these relations 
is the clearest indication that nothing definite or adequately 
considered is being said. The fact that, given certain elements 
arranged in a certain way, a certain further element can usually 
be introduced in one way and one way only <i>if a certain total 
effect is to be produced</i>, does, it is true, give a certain 
‘inevitability’ to the artist’s work. But what the effect is 
and whether the effect is worth while have still to be considered, 
and this inevitability has nothing to do with <i>a priori</i> 
rightness and is a matter simply of cause and effect. The salt 
required to make a soup palatable is ‘logically necessitated’ 
in this sense as much as any relation in a picture. The value 
lies not in the apprehension, conscious or subconscious, of the 
rightness of the relations, but in the total mental effect which, 
since they are right (i.e. since they work), they produce. </p>

transference of experiences in the strictest possible sense of 
transference—the sense in which a penny can be transferred from 
one pocket to another—and are led to most fantastic hypotheses. 
Blake seems sometimes to have believed that one single, the same, 
identical state of mind, imagined as a being or power, can occupy 
now one mind, now another, or many minds at once. Other thinkers, 
in less picturesque manners, have fallen back upon no less transcendental 
considerations as necessities in the explanation of communication. 
We must suppose, it is alleged, that human minds are wider than 
we ordinarily believe, that parts of one mind may pass over to 
become parts of another, that minds interpenetrate and intermingle, 
or even that particular minds are merely an illusory appearance 
and the underlying reality one mind whose facets or aspects are 
many. In this way it is easy to enter the maze. Probably some 
wanderings in it are unavoidable for all speculative persons 
at some period of their mental development. The only escape from 
it is by the original entrance. </p>

<p>For communication defined as strict transference of or participation 
in identical experiences does not occur. This is not a heart-breaking 
conclusion. No general theory, in fact, as to the nature or conditions 
of experiences can affect their value. For value is prior to 
all explanations. If actual transference and participation did 
occur we should of course be compelled to adopt a transcendental 
theory. It does not occur<a id="note21.1text"></a><a href="#note21.1">*</a> and no arguments which assume it 
have the least weight. </p>

<p>All that occurs is that, under certain conditions, separate minds 
have closely similar experiences. Those who are unable to accept 
this view reject it not on grounds of evidence, not through the 
ways in which the world influences them, but on grounds of desire, 
due to the influence of the contrary opinion on their attitudes 
to their fellows. At moments anyone may wish it otherwise; severance 
seems a deprivation; caught in a moment of maladjustment we feel 
that our essential insularity is a blight and a defect, and to 
accept the facts and upon them to found a new and more perfect 
adjustment is for all sensitive people in some situations difficult. 
But the true belief does not, and perhaps no true belief can, 
really deprive anyone of any values. Sad cases of bad systematisations 
there doubtless are, for which no readjustment is possible. A 
false belief may become an indispensable condition for the most 
important activities of individuals who without it break down 
into confusion. So it is with many religious beliefs; and in 
saying that the removal of such beliefs need involve no loss, 
and may involve great gains in values, we do not say that there 
are not certain individuals whose values will be destroyed in 
the process. We say only that adaptable people will find that 
most of their values can be retained after rejecting their errors, 
that compensations and equivalents for their losses are available, 
and that whole sets of fresh values become open to them through 
their better adjustment to the actual world in which they live. 
This is the justification for the opinion which has so often 
been held, that knowledge is the greatest of all goods. The opinion 
appears to be warranted. Knowledge <i>is</i>, we are slowly finding 
out, an indispensable condition for the attainment of the widest, 
most stable, and most important values. </p>

<p>We start then from the natural isolation and severance of minds. 
Their experiences at the best, under the most favourable circumstances, 
can be but similar. Communication, we shall say, takes place 
when one mind so acts upon its environment that another mind 
is influenced, and in that other mind an experience occurs which 
is like the experience in the first mind, and is caused in part 
by that experience. Communication is evidently a complicated 
affair, and capable of degrees at least in two respects. The 
two experiences may be more or less similar, and the second may 
be more or less dependent upon the first. If A and B are walking 
in the street together and A touches B and says, “There is the 
Lord Chief Justice,” B’s experience while he contemplates the 
dignitary is only adventitiously dependent upon A’s experience. 
But if A, having met the Lord Chief Justice, describes him to 
a friend afterwards in a quarry at Portland, for example, his 
friend’s experience will depend very largely upon the particular 
judges he may himself have encountered, and for the rest will 
derive its special features from A’s description. Unless A has 
remarkable gifts of description and B extraordinarily sensitive 
and discriminating receptive ability, their two experiences will 
tally at best but roughly. They may completely fail to tally 
without either being clearly aware of the fact. </p>

<p>In general, long and varied acquaintanceship, close familiarity, 
lives whose circumstances have often corresponded, in short an 
exceptional fund of common experience is needed, if people, in 
the absence of special communicative gifts, active and receptive, 
are to communicate, and even with these gifts the success of 
the communication in difficult cases depends upon the extent 
to which past similarities in experience can be made use of. 
Without such similarities communication is impossible. Difficult 
cases are those in which the speaker must himself supply and 
control a large part of the causes of the listener’s experience; 
in which correspondingly the listener has to struggle against 
the intrusions of elements from his own past experience which 
are irrelevant. When A can point and B gaze, the matter is sometimes 
easy; although, as is well known, a complex object, for example 
a landscape, where many different selections are possible corresponding 
to different emphases of interest, cannot be dealt with in so 
simple a manner. Less complex things in which the interesting 
feature is more salient, for example, a gentleman asleep in Church, 
may be merely indicated with more confidence of communication, 
although here again one person may feel indignation and another 
amusement at the sight. </p>

<p>In difficult cases the vehicle of communication must inevitably 
be complex. The effect of a word varies with the other words 
among which it is placed. What would be highly ambiguous by itself 
becomes definite in a suitable context. So it is throughout; 
the effect of any element depends upon the other elements present 
with it. Even in such shallow communication as is involved in 
merely making out the letters in a handwriting this principle 
is all-important, and in the deepest forms of communication the 
same principle holds good. To this is due the superiority of 
verse to prose for the most difficult and deepest communications, 
poetry being by far the more complex vehicle. A similar instance 
is the increased ambiguity of a monochromatic reproduction as 
compared with the original painting. What <i>difficulty</i> of 
communication depends upon we have already considered. It should 
not be confused with the difficulty of the matter communicated, 
although the two are often connected. Some very difficult calculations, 
for example, can be communicated with ease. <i>Depth</i> of communication 
likewise is not necessarily connected with difficulty. It is 
a name for the degree of completeness in the response required. 
A glance at the diagram on p. 116 will make this use of the term 
clear. Communications involving attitudes are deeper than those 
in which references alone are concerned. Abstract and analytic 
prose, in fact, depends for its success upon the shallowness 
of its draught. It must avoid any stirring of the emotions lest 
its required distinctions become obscured. </p>

<h2><a href="#chap22" id="chap22"></a>CHAPTER XXII <br><br>

<span class="smcap">The Availability of the Poet’s Experience</span> </h2>
<div class ="epigraph">
<p>That he is the wisest, the happiest and the best, inasmuch 
as he is a poet, is equally incontrovertible; the greatest poets 
have been men of the most spotless virtue, of the most consummate 
prudence, and, if we would look into the interior of their lives, 
the most fortunate of men.—<i>The Defence of Poetry</i>. </p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> special communicative gifts, either active or passive, which 
have been alluded to, are no peculiar irreducible abilities. 
They can be described in terms of activities already mentioned. 
The use of past similarities in experience and the control of 
these elements through the dependence of their effects upon one 
another, make up the speaker’s, the active communicator’s gift. 
Discrimination, suggestibility, free and clear resuscitation 
of elements of past experience <i>disentangled from one another</i>, 
and control of irrelevant personal details and accidents, make 
up the recipient’s gift. We may now consider these more closely. </p>

<p>Certain favourable and unfavourable special circumstances in 
the temperaments or characters of the persons concerned may be 
set aside. Thus courage or audacity, enterprise, goodwill, absence 
of undue pride or conceit, honesty, humaneness, humility in its 
finest sense, humour, tolerance, good health, and the Confucian 
characteristics of the ‘superior man’ are favourable general 
conditions for communication. But we will assume them present 
in sufficient degree and pass on to the less evident because 
more fundamental conditions. In the first place all those which 
we have enumerated as desirable in the recipient are also necessary 
in the artist. He is pre-eminently accessible to external influences 
and discriminating with regard to them. He is distinguished further 
by the freedom in which all these impressions are held in suspension, 
and by the ease with which they form new relations between themselves. 
The greatest difference between the artist or poet and the ordinary 
person is found, as has often been pointed out, in the range, 
delicacy, and freedom of the connections he is able to make between 
different elements of his experience. “All the images of nature 
were still present to him,” says Dryden, with felicity, of Shakespeare, 
“and he drew them not laboriously but luckily.” It is this available 
possession of the past which is the first characteristic of the 
adept in communication, of the poet or the artist. </p>

<p>Availability, not mere possession, however, is what is essential. 
Many people are endowed with memories of marble upon which time 
can do little to efface even the slightest mark, but they benefit 
little from their endowment. A merely repetitive retention is 
rather a disability than an asset in communication, since it 
makes the separation of the private and irrelevant from the essential 
so difficult. Persons to whom the past comes back as a whole 
are likely to be found in an asylum. </p>

<p>What is in question here is not memory, in the stricter sense 
in which past experience is dated and placed, but free reproduction. 
To be able to revive an experience is not to remember when and 
where and how it occurred, but merely to have that peculiar state 
of mind available. Why some experiences are available and others 
not is unfortunately still a matter for conjecture merely. The 
difficulty upon most accounts, Semon’s for example, is to explain 
why <i>all</i> our past experience is not being revived all the 
time. But some plausible conjectures are not difficult to make, 
and the absence of clear evidence or conclusive proof should 
not prevent our making them if they are recognised for conjectures. </p>

<p>How far an experience is revivable would seem to depend in the 
first place upon the interests, the impulses, active in the experience. 
Unless similar interests recur its revival would seem to be difficult. 
The original experience is built upon a number of impulses; it 
came about only through these impulses. We may even say that 
it is those impulses. The first condition for its revival is 
the occurrence of impulses similar to <i>some</i> of these. </p>

<p>The patient in the asylum occupied in reliving the same piece 
of experience indefinitely does so (if he does) because he is 
limited very strictly in the range of his possible impulses, 
other impulses not being allowed to intervene. Hence the completeness 
with which he is said to reconstruct the past. Most revival is 
distorted because only some of the original impulses are repeated, 
new impulses being-involved and a compromise resulting. </p>

<p>The impulses implicated in experiences may be many and varied 
or few and alike. An experience which has a very simple impulse 
structure will, we may suppose, tend to come back only when these 
impulses are again relatively dominant. Other things being equal 
it will have less chance of revival than an experience with a 
more complex structure. Recalling the illustration used in Chapter 
XIV, the broader the facet the more numerous are the positions 
from which the polyhedron will settle down on that facet. It 
is a first principle of psychology that the partial return only 
of a situation may reinstate the whole, and since most impulses 
have belonged in the past to many varied wholes there must evidently 
be much rivalry as to which wholes do actually recur. What seems 
to decide the dispute more than anything else is the character 
of the original connections between the parts. As has recently 
been emphasised by the exponents of <i>Gestalt-psychologie</i>, 
mere original contiguity or simultaneity is comparatively powerless 
to control revival. Compare the learning of a geometric theorem 
by heart with understanding it, or even a brief study of some 
building with mere daily familiarity. </p>

<p>What then is the difference between understanding a situation 
and the more usual reactions to it? It is a difference in the 
degree of organisation of the impulses which it arouses. It is 
the difference between a systematised complex response, or ordered 
sequence of responses, and a welter of responses. We must not 
take ‘understanding’ in too specialised a sense here, or we shall 
overlook the immense importance of this difference in determining 
revival. We are accustomed to make an artificial distinction 
between intellectual or theoretical and non-intellectual or emotional 
mental activities. To understand a situation in the sense here 
intended is not necessarily to reflect upon it, to inquire into 
its principles and consciously distinguish its characters, but 
to respond to it as a whole, in a coherent way which allows its 
parts their due share and their proper independence in the response. 
Experience which has this organised character, it is reasonable 
to suppose, has more chance of revival, is more available as 
a whole and in parts, than more confused experience. </p>

<p>Contrast the behaviour of the sleepy and the fully awake, of 
the normal man with the lightly and the more deeply anæsthetised 
patient, of the starved or fevered with the healthy. To describe 
these differences in neural potency, and to mark the degree of 
physiological efficiency, Dr Head has recently<a id="note22.1text"></a><a href="#note22.1">†</a> suggested the 
term <i>vigilance</i>, a useful addition to our symbolic machinery. 
In a high state of vigilance the nervous system reacts to stimuli 
with highly adapted, discriminating, and ordered responses; in 
a lowered state of vigilance the responses are less discriminating, 
less delicately adapted. Whether we are considering the decerebrate 
preparation or the intact poet, the simplest automatisms or the 
most highly conscious acts, what happens in a given stimulus 
situation varies with the vigilance of the appropriate portion 
of the nervous system. The point as regards revival can be put 
conveniently by saying that experiences of high vigilance are 
the most likely to be available. The degree of vigilance of the 
individual at the moment at which revival is attempted is, of 
course, equally but more evidently an important factor. </p>

<p>The answer then, at least in part, to the problem of how the 
poet’s experience is more than usually available to him is that 
it is, as he undergoes it, more than usually organised through 
his more than usual vigilance. Connections become established 
for him which in the ordinary mind, much more rigid and exclusive 
in its play of impulses, are never effected, and it is through 
these original connections that so much more of his past comes 
to be freely revivable for him at need. </p>

<p>The same explanation may be put in another way. In order to keep 
any steadiness and clarity in his attitudes the ordinary man 
is under the necessity on most occasions of suppressing the greater 
part of the impulses which the situation might arouse. He is 
incapable of organising them; therefore they have to be left 
out. In the same situation the artist is able to admit far more 
without confusion. Hence the fact that his resultant behaviour 
is apt to cause dismay, irritation or envy, or to seem incomprehensible. 
The wheeling of the pigeons in Trafalgar Square may seem to have 
no relation to the colour of the water in the basins, or to the 
tones of a speaker’s voice or to the drift of his remarks. A 
narrow field of stimulation is all that we can manage, and we 
overlook the rest. But the artist does not, and when he needs 
it, he has it at his disposal. </p>

<p>The dangers to which he is exposed, the apparent inconsequence, 
the difficulty on many occasions of co-operating with him, of 
relying upon him, of predicting what he will do, are evident 
and often expatiated upon. His superficial resemblance to persons 
who are merely mental chaoses, unorganised, without selective 
ability and of weak and diffused attention, is likewise clear. 
Essentially he is the opposite of these. </p>

<h2><a href="#chap23" id="chap23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII <br><br>

<span class="smcap">Tolstoy’s Infection Theory</span> </h2>
<div class ="epigraph">
<p style="text-align: center; text-indent:0em">Beauty is no quality in things themselves; it exists merely in the <br>
mind which contemplates them.—<i>Hume</i>. </p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is strange that speculations upon the arts should so rarely 
have begun from the most obvious fact about them. Mr Roger Fry, 
in his interesting Retrospect, records the shock with which Tolstoy’s 
insistence upon communication struck contemporary students in 
England. “What remained of immense importance was the idea that 
a work of art was not the record of beauty already existent 
elsewhere, but the expression of an emotion felt by the artist 
and conveyed to the spectator.”<a id="note23.1text"></a><a href="#note23.1">†</a> It will be useful to examine 
Tolstoy’s account. He formulates his theory<a id="note23.2text"></a><a href="#note23.2">†</a> as follows: “Art 
becomes more or less infectious in consequence of three conditions: </p>

<p class="hangingindent">(i) In consequence of a greater or lesser 
peculiarity of the sensation conveyed. </p>

<p class="hangingindent">(ii) In consequence of a greater or lesser 
clearness of the transmission of this 
sensation. </p>

<p class="hangingindent">(iii) In consequence of the sincerity of the 
artist, that is, of the greater or lesser 
force with which the artist himself 
experiences the sensation which he is 
conveying.” </p>

<p class="noindent" style="padding-top:.5em">He adds, in curious contradiction to his other view which we 
have already discussed, “Not only is the infectiousness a certain 
sign of art, but the degree of the infection is the only standard 
of the value of art.” </p>

<p>This contradiction we may perhaps remove or at least mitigate 
if we notice that ‘degree of infection’ is a highly ambiguous 
phrase. It may be equivalent to— </p>

<p class="hangingindent">(i) the number of persons who may be infected,</p>

<p class="hangingindent">(ii) the completeness with which the experience is reproduced 
in them. </p>

<p class="noindent" style="padding-top:.5em">These are the two most relevant senses here, and both are involved 
in Tolstoy’s exposition. The first would bring this view into 
connection with his doctrine that only so far as art is accessible 
to all men is it valuable. The second, however, cannot be reconciled 
with that view, but that he held it cannot be doubted. “The more 
the sensation to be conveyed is special,” he goes on, “the more 
strongly does it act upon the receiver; the more special the 
condition of the mind is, to which the reader is transferred, 
the more willingly and the more powerfully does he blend with 
it.” </p>

<p>This is plainly untrue. What Tolstoy would have said with more 
reflection is that some special experiences are interesting and 
owe their attraction partly to their strangeness, their unusual 
character. But many unusual and special experiences are unattractive 
and repellent. Dyspeptics, amateurs of psycho-analysis, fishermen, 
and golfers, have very often most remarkable things to recount. 
We shun having to listen precisely because they are so special. 
Further, many experiences by their very oddness are incommunicable. </p>

<p>Only so far as common interests are aroused does the ease and 
completeness of transmission depend upon the rarity and strangeness 
of the experience communicated. With this proviso Tolstoy’s remark 
is obviously justified. That he should have stressed it is an 
indication of his sincerity and candour. So much of his doctrine 
is a simple denial that special experiences are a fit subject 
for art. A division between experiences which though special 
are yet in the main path of humanity and accessible to all men 
if they are sufficiently finely developed in normal directions, 
and those other special experiences which are due to abnormality, 
disease, or eccentric and erratic specialisation, is what he 
would have added if his attention had been drawn to the point. 
He would have enjoyed classifying the fashionables and intellectuals, 
the etiolate cultured classes, among the insane. </p>

<p>The second condition of infectiousness, the greater or less clearness 
of the transmission of the sensation, is more important. How 
to obtain clear transmission is precisely the problem of communication. 
We have seen that it is a matter of the availability of common 
experiences, the elicitation of these by a suitable vehicle, 
and the control and extrusion of irrelevant elements, so far 
as they arise, through the complexity of the vehicle. </p>

<p>The third condition, the sincerity of the artist, is more obscure. 
Tolstoy’s own elucidation carries us but a little way. What is 
this force with which an experience occurs? Certainly experiences 
may be of the utmost intensity without thereby being any more 
easy to convey. A lightning flash, for example, which just misses 
one upon a summit, is much more difficult to describe than the 
same flash seen from the valley. Tolstoy, however, is speaking 
of the experience as evoked by the artist in the course of communication, 
of the “emotion, kindred to that which was before the subject 
of contemplation”, which then “is gradually produced and does 
itself exist in the mind”, to quote Wordsworth’s celebrated account 
of the source of poetry. He is speaking of the fullness, steadiness 
and clearness with which the experience to be communicated develops 
in the mind of the communicator at the moment of expression. 
Inrushes of emotion, accompanied by scraps and odd bits of imagery, 
thought and incipient activity, are not uncommon, and the process 
of jotting down what comes to mind at the moment is all that 
the would-be poet can achieve. </p>

<div class="poetry"><p style="padding-left:15%; text-indent:0em; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em">Round him much embryo, much abortion lay, <br>
Much future ode and abdicated play: <br>
Nonsense precipitate like running lead, <br>
Which slipped through cracks and zigzags of the head. </p></div>

<p class="noindent">Opposed to him is the poet who “described in <i>ideal</i> perfection, 
brings the whole soul of man into activity. . . .” His is “a 
more than usual state of emotion, with more than usual order; 
judgment ever awake, and steady self-possession, with enthusiasm 
and feeling profound or vehement<a id="note23.3text"></a><a href="#note23.3">†</a>.” As so often, Coleridge 
drops the invaluable hint almost inadvertently. The wholeness 
of the mind in the creative moment is the essential consideration, 
the free participation in the evocation of the experience of 
all the impulses, conscious or unconscious, relevant to it, without 
suppressions or restrictions. As we have seen, this completeness 
or wholeness is the rarest and the most difficult condition required 
for supreme communicative ability. How it works we have also 
seen, and if this is, as doubtless it must be, what Tolstoy meant 
by sincerity, however queer some of his tests for it were, we 
have found yet another indication of how great his contribution 
to critical theory, under happier circumstances, might have been. </p>

<span class="smcap">The Normality of the Artist</span></h2>
<div class ="epigraph">
<p class="hangingindent">Prose is an uninterrupted, polite warfare with poetry . . . 
every abstraction wants to have a jibe at poetry and wishes 
to be uttered with a mocking voice.—<i>The Joyful Wisdom</i>. </p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">If</span> the availability of his past experience is the first characteristic 
of the poet, the second is what we may provisionally call his 
normality. So far as his experience does not tally with that 
of those with whom he communicates, there will be failure. But 
both the sense in which it must tally and the sense in which 
the artist is normal need to be carefully considered. </p>

<p>Within racial<a id="note24.1text"></a><a href="#note24.1">*</a> boundaries, and perhaps within the limits of 
certain very general types,<a id="note24.2text"></a><a href="#note24.2">*</a> many impulses are common to all 
men. Their stimuli and the courses which they take seem to be 
uniform. At the same time there are many other impulses which 
are not uniform. It is difficult to give instances, since there 
are so few names for impulses, but sounds are fairly uniform 
while words used in isolation are fairly ambiguous stimuli. Impulses 
could, if we knew enough, be arranged in an order of general 
uniformity or stability. Some impulses remain the same, taking 
the same course on the same occasions, from age to age, from 
prehistoric times until to-day. Some change as fashions change. 
Between the two extremes are the vast majority; neither, when 
the nervous system is vigilant, very fixed nor very erratic; 
set off by a given stimulus and taking the course they do because 
other impulses are also active or have just been active. </p>

<p>For successful communication a number of impulses with their 
effective stimuli must be common to the communicators, and further 
the general ways in which impulses modify one another must be 
shared. We evidently cannot expect that many total situations 
and responses will have been common, and it is not necessary 
that they should be. Within limits the disparities can be overcome 
by what is called imagination. </p>

<p>There is nothing peculiarly mysterious about imagination. It 
is no more marvellous than any other of the ways of the 
mind. Yet it has so often been treated as an arcanum that we 
naturally approach it with caution. It is desirable at least 
to avoid part of the fate which befell Coleridge,<a id="note24.3text"></a><a href="#note24.3">*</a> and our 
account will be devoid of theological implications. </p>

<p>Given some impulses active others are thereby aroused in the 
absence of what would otherwise be their necessary stimuli. Such 
impulses I call imaginative, whether images occur or not, for 
image-production is not at all essentially involved in what the 
critic is interested in as imagination. Which other impulses 
are brought in is in part determined by which were co-operative 
together originally when all the impulses had their own stimuli, 
that is to say, in the non-imaginary experiences from which the 
imaginary experience derives. In so far as this factor comes 
in the imagination may be said to be <i>repetitive</i>. The imagination 
we are concerned with may be called <i>formative</i><a id="note24.4text"></a><a href="#note24.4">*</a> by way 
of distinction. For present circumstances are at least as important. 
Remember in a changed mood a scene which took place under a strong 
emotion. How altered is its every aspect! The selection of the 
impulses which take effect is changed; the impulses are distorted, 
they run in different courses. The imaginative construction is 
always at least as much determined by what is going on in the 
present as by what went on in the past, <i>pasts</i> rather, 
whence it springs. </p>

<p>Many of the most curious features of the arts, the limitation 
of their number, their formal characteristics and the conditions 
of impersonality, detachment and so forth, which have given rise 
to much confused discussion of the ‘æsthetic’ state for example, 
are explained by this fact. In difficult communication the artist 
must find some means of so controlling a part of the recipient’s 
experience that the imaginative development will be governed 
by this part and not left to the accidents of repetition which 
will differ naturally from individual to individual. As a basis 
for every art, therefore, will be found a type of impulse which 
is extraordinarily uniform, which fixes the framework, as it 
were, within which the rest of the response develops. These are 
among the most uniform impulses, among those which come nearest 
to having a one-one correlation with their stimuli, of all those 
which we experience. </p>

<p>In poetry, rhythm metre and tune or cadence; in music, rhythm 
pitch timbre and tune; in painting, form and colour; in sculpture, 
volume and stress; in all the arts, what are usually called the 
formal elements are the stimuli, simple or complex, which can 
be most depended upon to produce uniform responses. It is true 
that these responses are not so uniform as the reflexes, as sneezing 
or blinking for example. But even these are to a considerable 
extent subject to interference and modification by impulses of 
higher levels. What communication requires is responses which 
are uniform, sufficiently varied, and capable of being set off 
by stimuli which are physically manageable. These three requisites 
explain why the number of the arts is limited and why formal 
elements have such importance. </p>

<p>They are the skeleton or scaffolding upon or within which the 
further impulses involved in the communication are supported. 
They supply the present dependable part of the experience by 
which the rest, the more erratic, ambiguous part of the imaginative 
development, is controlled. By themselves (although there has 
been a natural tendency in criticism to maintain the contrary 
opinion) they are often quite inadequate. As we have seen, differences 
of all degrees, both between and within the arts, exist. </p>

<p>The fashion in which the poet’s impulses must tally with those 
of his readers, will now be moderately clear. The poet is in 
the least favourable position, perhaps, among the artists, but 
as a compensation the range and fullness of the communications 
open to him is, if he can overcome the difficulties, very great. 
But evidently the least eccentricity on his part, either in the 
responses which he makes to rhythms and verbal tunes, or in the 
ways in which these govern and modify his further responses or 
are modified by them, will be disastrous. It is the same for 
all the arts. A defective or eccentric colour sensibility, a 
common defect as is well known, may play havoc with an artist’s 
work, <i>qua</i> communication, without necessarily involving 
any deficiency of value in his own experience. It is theoretically 
possible for an individual to develop in himself states of mind 
of very high value and yet to be so unusual in his own sensibility 
as to seem ridiculous or be incomprehensible to others. The question 
then arises as to which is in the right, the artist or his uncomprehending 
critics. This frequent dilemma raised alike by great innovating 
artists and by nincompoops brings us back to the problem of normality. </p>

<p>To be normal is to be a standard, but not, as things are and 
are likely to remain, an average; and to inquire into the characters 
of the norm or to ask who are normal is to raise a question as 
to value. The artist departs from the average, but so do other 
people. His departure, however, is one of the reasons why we 
attend to his work; other people’s departures may be reasons 
why we should not. What are the main differences which decide 
whether a departure is a merit or a defect? </p>

<p>The theory of value outlined above indicates some of these differences. 
If the artist’s organisation is such as to allow him a fuller 
life than the average, with less unnecessary interference between 
its component impulses, then plainly we should do well to be 
more like him, <i>if we can</i> and as far as we can. But the 
qualification, <i>if we can</i>, has far-reaching consequences. 
Politically it <i>might</i> be better for the community to be 
organised on the model of ant and bee communities, but, since 
it cannot, the question whether we should try to make it so does 
not arise. Similarly, if the artist’s organisation<a id="note24.5text"></a><a href="#note24.5">*</a> is so eccentric 
as to make general approximation to it impossible, or if a general 
approximation would involve (people being what they are) greater 
losses than gains, then however admirable it may be in itself, 
we shall be justified in neglecting it. The case, if it indeed 
occurs, is exceptional but instructive theoretically. What is 
excellent and what is to be imitated are not necessarily the 
same. But it is interesting to note that mentalities to which 
the usual and ordinary man is not capable of approximating without 
loss can almost always be shown to be defective, and that the 
defects themselves are the barrier to approximation. Certain 
mystical poets are perhaps as good an example of this as any. 
However admirable the experience of a Boehme or a Blake, of a 
Nietzsche or of the Apocalypst, the features which prevent general 
participation in it, the barriers to communication, are not the 
features upon which its value chiefly depends. It is the inchoate 
part of Blake’s personality which makes him incomprehensible, 
not the parts which were better organised than those of every 
one else. </p>

<p>The explanation of the rarity of admirable though utterly eccentric 
experience is not difficult. The metaphorical remark that we 
are all branches of the same tree is its most compendious form. 
So much must be alike in the nature of all men, their situation 
in the world so much the same, and organisation building upon 
this basis must depend upon such similar processes, that variation 
both wide and successful is most unlikely. That we are apt to 
exaggerate the differences between men is well known. If we consider 
what is usually called mind, alone, we may well suppose that 
minds may differ <i>toto cœlo</i>, but if we look more carefully, 
taking account of the whole man, including his spinal reflexes 
for example, seeing his mind as but the most delicate and most 
advanced part of his total organisation, we shall not be tempted 
to think him so diverse. People of course do seem extraordinarily 
different in the ways in which they think and feel. But we are 
specialised to detect these differences. Further, we tend constantly 
to overlook differences in situation which would explain differences 
in behaviour. We assume to a ridiculous extent that what is stimulating 
us will stimulate others in the same way, forgetting that what 
will happen depends upon what has happened before and upon what 
is already happening within, about which we can usually know 
little. </p>

<p>The ways then in which the artist will differ from the average 
will as a rule presuppose an immense degree of similarity. They 
will be further developments of organisations already well advanced 
in the majority. His variations will be confined to the newest, 
the most plastic, the least fixed part of the mind, the parts 
for which reorganisation is most easy. Thus his differences are 
far less serious obstacles to communication than, shall we say, 
such differences as divide the hypochondriac from the healthy. 
And, further, so far as they require reorganisation there will 
commonly be good reasons why this should be carried out. We should 
not forget that finer organisation is the most successful way 
of relieving strain, a fact of relevance in the theory of evolution. 
The new response will be more advantageous than the old, more 
successful in satisfying varied appetencies. </p>

<p>But the advantages may be localised or general, minor as well 
as major. The artist stands at the parting of a multitude of 
ways. His advance may be and often is in a direction which if 
followed up would be generally disadvantageous although for the 
moment it leads to an increase of value. The metaphor is of course 
insufficient. We can improve it by substituting a manifold of 
many dimensions for the cross-roads. Which way is the mind to 
grow and which ways are compatible with which is the question. 
There are specialist and universal poets, and the specialist 
may be developing in a manner either consistent or inconsistent<a id="note24.6text"></a><a href="#note24.6">*</a> 
with general development, a consideration of extreme importance 
in judging the value of his work. Its bearing upon the permanence 
of his work will be discussed later. </p>

<p>At any moment, in any situation, a variety of attitudes is possible. 
Which is the best is decided not only by the impulses which gain 
organised satisfaction in the attitude but also by the effect 
of the attitude upon the rest of the organisation of the individual. 
We should have to consider the whole system and all the possibilities 
of all probable situations which might arise if we were to be 
sure that any one attitude is the best. Since we cannot do this, 
but can only note the most obvious objections to some, we have 
to be content if we can avoid those attitudes which are most 
evidently wasteful. </p>

<p>For the normality of the poet is to be estimated in terms of 
waste. Most human attitudes are wasteful, some to a shocking 
degree. The mind which is, so far as can be seen, least wasteful, 
we take as a norm or standard, and, if possible, we develop in 
our degree similar experiences. The taking of the norm is for 
the most part done unconsciously by mere preference, by the shock 
of delight which follows the release of stifled impulse into 
organised freedom. Often the choice is mistaken, the advantage 
which leads to preference is too localised, involves losses in 
the end, losses round the next corner as it were. </p>

<p>Little by little experience corrects such illusory preference, 
not through reflection—almost all critical choices are irreflective, 
spontaneous, as some say—but through unconscious reorganisation 
of impulses. We rarely change our tastes, we rather find them 
changed. We return to the poems which made us weep tears of delight 
when we were young and find them dusty rhetoric. With a tender 
hurt inside we wonder what has happened. </p>

<p>Sometimes, of course, experience corrects nothing. There may 
be nothing which needs correcting, or too much. The localised 
advantage, the sweet aching thrill of the Boosey Ballad— </p>

<span class="smcap">Badness in Poetry</span></h2>
<div class="epigraph"><div class="poetry">
<p style="text-indent:0em; text-align:center">Il faut dissiper un malentendu: nous sommes pourris d’art! </p>
<p style="text-align:right; padding-right:5%"><i>Le Corbusier-Saugnier</i>. </p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> theory of badness in poetry has never received the study 
which it deserves, partly on account of its difficulty. For with 
bad art even more than with good unless we are careful to distinguish 
the communicative from the value aspects, even when these are 
connected, we shall find the issues obscured. Sometimes art is 
bad because communication is defective, the vehicle inoperative; 
sometimes because the experience communicated is worthless; sometimes 
for both reasons. It would perhaps be best to restrict the term 
bad art to cases in which genuine communication does to a considerable 
degree take place, what is communicated being worthless, and 
to call the other cases defective art. But this is not the usual 
practice of critics, any work which produces an experience displeasing 
to the critic being commonly called bad, whether or not this 
experience is like that responsible for the work. </p>

<p>Let us begin by considering an instance of defective communication; 
choosing an example in which it is likely that the original experience 
had some value. </p>

<div class="poetry"><p style="text-indent:0em; text-align:center; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top:1em;">THE POOL </p>
<div class="poetry"><p style="padding-left:30%; text-indent:0em; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top:.5em; margin-bottom:1em">Are you alive? <br>
I touch you. <br>
You quiver like a sea-fish. <br>
I cover you with my net. <br>
What are you—banded one? </p></div>

<p class="noindent">I take a complete work to avoid possible unfairness. Here we 
have the whole of the link which is to mediate between the experiences 
of the author and of the reader. Aristotle, in a different connection, 
it is true, and for different reasons, affirmed that a work of 
art must possess a certain magnitude, and we can adapt his remark 
here. Not the brevity only of the vehicle, but its simplicity, 
makes it ineffective. The sacrifice of metre in free verse needs, 
in almost all cases, to be compensated by length. The loss of 
so much of the formal structure leads otherwise to tenuousness 
and ambiguity. Even when, as here, the original experience is 
presumably slight, tenuous and fleeting, the mere correspondence 
of matter to form is insufficient. The experience evoked in the 
reader is not sufficiently specific. A poet may, it is true, 
make an unlimited demand upon his reader, and the greatest poets 
make the greatest claim, but the demand made must be proportional 
to the poet’s own contribution. The reader here supplies too 
much of the poem. Had the poet said only, “I went and poked about 
for rocklings and caught the pool itself”, the reader, who converts 
what is printed above into a poem, would still have been able 
to construct an experience of equal value; for what results is 
almost independent of the author. </p>

<p>To pass to a case in which communication is successful, where 
the objection lies to what is communicated: </p>

<div class="poetry"><p style="padding-left:5%; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top:1em">After the fierce midsummer all ablaze </p>

<p style="padding-left:10%; font-size: 0.9em; margin-bottom: 1em">And yet, and yet, these days are incomplete. </p></div>

<p>As to the success of the communication there can be no question. 
Both the popularity of the author, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, of whose 
work this is a favourable specimen, and records of the response 
made by well-educated persons, who read it without being aware 
of the authorship, leave this beyond doubt. It reproduces the 
state of mind of the writer very exactly. With a very numerous 
class of readers pleasure and admiration ensue. The explanation 
is, probably, in the soothing effect of aligning the very active 
Love-Friendship groups of impulses with so settled yet rich a 
group as the Summer-Autumn simile brings in. The mind finds for 
a moment an attitude in which to contemplate a pair of situations 
(Love and Friendship) together, situations which are for many 
minds particularly difficult to see together. The heavy regular 
rhythm, the dead stamp of the rimes, the obviousness of the descriptions 
(‘mellow, mild, St Martin’; ‘cool verdant vales’) their alliteration, 
the triteness of the close, all these accentuate the impression 
of conclusiveness. The restless spirit is appeased, one of its 
chief problems is made to seem as if, regarded from a lofty, 
all-embracing standpoint, it is no problem but a process of nature. </p>

<br>

<p>This reconciliation, this appeasement, is common to much good 
and to much bad poetry alike. But the value of it depends upon 
the level of organisation at which it takes place, upon whether 
the reconciled impulses are adequate or inadequate. In this case 
those who have adequate impulses as regards any of the four main 
systems involved, Summer, Autumn, Love, Friendship, are not appeased. 
Only for those who make certain conventional, stereotyped maladjustments 
instead, does the magic work. </p>

<p>The nature and source of these stock conventional attitudes is 
of great interest. Suggestion is very largely responsible for 
them. The normal child under the age of ten is probably free 
from them, or at least with him they have no fixity or privileged 
standing. But as general reflection develops the place of the 
free direct play of experience is taken by the deliberate organisation 
of attitudes, a clumsy and crude substitute. ‘Ideas’, as they 
are commonly called, arise. A boy’s ‘Idea’ of Friendship or of 
Summer or of his Country is not, though the name would seem to 
imply it, primarily an intellectual affair. It is rather an attitude, 
or set of attitudes, of tendencies to act in certain fashions 
rather than others. Now reflection, unless very prolonged and 
very arduous, tends to fix the attitude by making us dwell in 
it, by <i>removing us from experience</i>. In the development 
of any attitude there are stages, points of rest, of relatively 
greater stability. These, as we dwell in them, become more and 
more difficult to pass, and it is not surprising that most people 
remain all their lives in various halfway houses. </p>

<p>These stages or levels of emotional adjustment seem, for the 
most part, to be fixed not by any special suitability to circumstances, 
certainly not to present circumstances, but much more by social 
suggestion and by accidents which withdraw us from actual experience, 
the one force which might push us further. At present bad literature, 
bad art, the cinema, etc., are an influence of the first importance 
in fixing immature and actually inapplicable attitudes to most 
things. Even the decision as to what constitutes a pretty girl 
or a handsome young man, an affair apparently natural and personal 
enough, is largely determined by magazine covers and movie stars. 
The quite common opinion that the arts have after all very little 
effect upon the community shows only that too little attention 
is being paid to the effects of bad art. </p>

<p>The losses incurred by these artificial fixations of attitudes 
are evident. Through them the average adult is worse, not better 
adjusted to the possibilities of his existence than the child. 
He is even in the most important things functionally unable to 
face facts: do what he will he is only able to face fictions, 
fictions projected by his own stock responses. </p>

<p>Against these stock responses the artist’s internal and external 
conflicts are fought, and with them the popular writer’s triumphs 
are made. Any combination of these general Ideas, hit at the 
right level or halting point of development, is, if suitably 
advertised, certain of success. Best-sellers in all the arts, 
exemplifying as they do the most general levels of attitude development, 
are worthy of very close study. No theory of criticism is satisfactory 
which is not able to explain their wide appeal and to give clear 
reasons why those who disdain them are not necessarily snobs. </p>

<p>The critic and the Sales Manager are not ordinarily regarded 
as of the same craft, nor are the poet and the advertising agent. 
It is true that some serious artists are occasionally tempted 
into poster designing. It is, however, doubtful whether their 
work pays. But the written appeals which have the soundest financial 
prospects as estimated by the most able American advertisers 
are such that no critic can safely ignore them. For they do undoubtedly 
represent the literary ideals present and future of the people 
to whom they are addressed.<a id="note25.1text"></a><a href="#note25.1">*</a> They are tested in a way which 
few other forms of literature are tested, their effects are watched 
by adepts whose livelihood depends upon the accuracy of their 
judgment, and they are among the best indices available of what 
is happening to taste. Criticism will justify itself as an applied, 
science when it is able to indicate how an advertisement may 
be profitable without necessarily being crass. We shall see later 
under what conditions popularity and possible high value are 
compatible. </p>

<p>The strongest objection to, let us say, the sonnet we have quoted, 
is that a person who enjoys it, through the very organisation 
of his responses which enables him to enjoy it, is debarred from 
appreciating many things which, if he could appreciate them, 
he would prefer. We must not, of course, forget those variations 
in psychological efficiency discussed in Chapter XXII as degrees 
of vigilance. Even a good critic at a sufficiently low ebb of 
neural potency might mistake such a sonnet for one of Shakespeare’s 
or with more ease for one of Rossetti’s. But when vigilance was 
restored he would see, or at least feel, the differences. The 
point is that a reader who, at a high degree of vigilance, thoroughly 
enters into and enjoys this class of verse, is necessarily so 
organised that he will fail to respond to poetry. Time and much 
varied experience might change him sufficiently, but by then 
he would no longer be able to enjoy such verse, he would no longer 
be the same person. </p>

<p>A general statement such as this about the incompatibility of 
inexpressibly complex adjustments must naturally be incapable 
of strict proof. Individuals with alternating personalities and 
subject to fugues would have to be considered. So would the phenomena 
of ‘mutations of regime’ unaccompanied by change of vigilance 
if such occur. None the less very much evidence substantiates 
the statement. The experience of all those who have passed through 
the stages in the development of attitudes presupposed by great 
poetry is probably conclusive. </p>

<p>Even though the intricacies of the nervous system should be capable 
of getting round this objection, there remain sufficient other 
reasons why indulgence in verse of this character should be condemned. 
There can be no doubt whatever that the value of the experience 
which results from it is small. On a pleasure theory of value 
there might well be doubt, since those who do enjoy it certainly 
appear to enjoy it in a high degree. But on the theory here maintained, 
the fact that those who have passed through the stage of enjoying 
the <i>Poems of Passion</i> to that of enjoying the bulk of the 
contents of the <i>Golden Treasury</i>, for example, do not return, 
settles the matter. We must bear in mind, of course, the conditions 
which have to be satisfied before this test is conclusive. That 
a man who has passed through the stage of drinking nothing but 
beer to the stage of drinking nothing but brandy rarely returns, 
does not prove that brandy is the better drink. It merely proves 
that it is the more efficient intoxicant. We have to ask in applying 
the test what the responses in question are, and in the case 
of poetry they are so varied, so representative of all the activities 
of life, that actual universal preference on the part of those 
who have tried both kinds fairly is the same (on our view) as 
superiority in value of the one over the other. Keats, by universal 
qualified opinion, is a more efficient poet than Wilcox, and 
that is the same thing as saying that his works are more valuable. </p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Ambiguity</span> in a poem, as with any other communication, may be 
the fault of the poet or of the reader. The ambiguities due to 
erratic reading are as important for criticism as others, and 
practically more troublesome. There are strong social incentives 
for overlooking them. Talking to one another we assume, in nine 
cases out of ten like the merest simpletons, that our readings 
agree, and that when we differ in our opinions it is something 
else, not our experiences but our judgments about them which 
are at variance. Most discussion about works of art is waste 
of time <i>as communication</i> for this reason. It may, of course, 
have great value as a means by which people may severally develop 
their own reactions. </p>

<p>These assumptions which so densely obscure the issue raise innumerable 
practical difficulties both for criticism and for the construction 
of a theory of criticism. It is well worth while to analyse typical 
situations a little further. </p>

<p>The closing lines of the Fifth Sonnet of Wordsworth’s River Duddon 
series will afford a convenient instance:— </p>

<div class="poetry"><p style="padding-left:15%; text-indent:0em; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em">Sole listener, Duddon! to the breeze that played <br>
With thy clear voice, I caught the fitful sound <br>
Wafted o’er sullen moss and craggy mound, <br>
Unfruitful solitudes that seemed to upbraid <br>
The sun in heaven!—but now, to form a shade <br>
For thee, green alders have together wound <br>
Their foliage; ashes flung their arms around; <br>
And birch trees risen in silver colonnade. <br>
And thou hast also tempted here to rise, <br>
Mid sheltering pines, this cottage rude and grey; <br>
Whose ruddy children, by the mother’s eyes <br>
Carelessly watched, sport through the summer day, <br>
Thy pleased associates—light as endless May <br>
On infant bosoms lonely nature lies. </p></div>

<p>Two readers who found themselves, as they thought, in entire 
agreement as to the excellence of this sonnet, and especially 
as to the beauty of its close, were surprised shortly afterwards 
to discover that they had been reading quite different poems. 
By the one the last sentence was interpreted as saying that the 
gloom of lonely nature, of sullen moss and craggy ground, however 
it might seem later on in life, had no oppressive effect upon 
the children. By the other it was read as saying that however 
barren and gloomy might be the scene, actually lonely nature 
there in itself had no such character, but was, as it were, floating 
“light as endless May on infant bosoms”. The two readings, by 
throwing their effect back upon what had preceded and in addition 
completely altering the rhythm of the close, produced what it 
is no exaggeration to describe as two different poems. Neither 
would be uncharacteristic of Wordsworth, although doubtless the 
first reading is the one to be accepted. </p>

<p>This exemplifies what is perhaps the rarest case,<a id="note26.1text"></a><a href="#note26.1">*</a> that in 
which agreement as to value covers an actual grave difference 
in the experiences valued. More usually there is some genuine 
source for the agreement, to be found in some common character 
of the experiences. What this common character is may be difficult 
to discover. It may be merely the rhythm, or the cadence of some 
phrase, or the form of a sequence of references. But sometimes, 
if it is a more obvious part, such as a description or metaphor, 
a discussion between critical readers, who are aware that their 
experiences differ, will bring it to light. </p>

<p>Another common case is exemplified by some famous discussions 
of <i>Hamlet</i>. It is curious that people with such different 
conceptions of the character of Hamlet himself and of the action 
of the play, have been able to agree none the less as to its 
value as a whole, apart, of course, from its incidental values. 
Much has to be discounted in estimating this agreement. On some 
interpretations praise of the play as a whole is certainly insincere. 
On the interpretation which makes Claudius the hero, whose tragic 
frailty lies in the fact that his long-suffering patience with 
the baseless suspicions of the crazy nuisance Hamlet breaks down 
in the end and brings the noble monarch to disaster, there would 
be little beyond the playwright’s subtlety which could honestly 
be commended. But with all allowances it seems certain that widely 
different interpretations have seemed to good critics to result 
in the same peculiar high value of tragedy. The explanation is 
that tragic value is a general not a specific character of responses. 
Just as a collision between motorcars and a collision between 
ships are equally collisions, so the impulses whose equilibrium 
produces the <i>catharsis</i> of tragedy may be very varied, 
provided that their relations to one another are correct. </p>

<p>Very many of the values of the arts are of this general kind. 
Besides the experiences which result from the building up of 
connected attitudes, there are those produced by the breaking 
down of some attitude which is a clog and a bar to other activities. 
From Blake’s “Truly, my Satan, thou art but a dunce”,<a id="note26.2text"></a><a href="#note26.2">†</a> to Voltaire’s 
“Bon père de famille est capable de tout”, such works can be 
found in all degrees. It matters little what the detail of the 
impulses which make up the obstructing attitude for different 
people in each case may be. This often varies, but when the attitude 
collapses the effect can be agreed upon. The great masters of 
irony—Rabelais and the Flaubert of <i>Bouvard et Pécuchet</i>—are 
the chief exponents of this kind of exorcism. </p>

of Elizabethan Drama. <i>The Pilgrim’s Progress</i>, <i>Robinson 
Crusoe</i>, <i>Gulliver’s Travels</i>, the Ballads, are other 
instances. The differences between such things and, for example, 
the work of Donne, Milton, Blake, Landor, Stendhal, Henry James, 
Baudelaire raise some of the most interesting of critical problems. </p>

<p>There is a common opinion, sometimes very strongly held, that 
a work which appeals to all kinds and all degrees of men is thereby 
proved to be greater, more valuable, than one which appeals only 
to some. There may be a confusion in this opinion. The sum of 
value yielded, since men actually are of different degrees, the 
social value that is to say of such work, will naturally be greater. 
But it does not follow that the maximum value for the reader 
of the highest level need be greater. The common belief that 
it is necessarily greater, that the work of wide appeal must 
be in itself a more admirable thing than work which appeals only 
to those who discriminate finely, is due to the assumption that 
it appeals everywhere for the same reasons and thus is shown 
to touch something essential and fundamental in human nature. 
But no one in a position to judge, who has, for example, some 
experience of the teaching of English, will maintain that Shakespeare’s 
appeal, to take the chief instance, is homogeneous. Different 
people read and go to see the same play for utterly different 
reasons. Where two people applaud we tend to assume, in spite 
of our better knowledge, that their experiences have been the 
same: the experience of the first would often be nauseous to 
the second, if by accident they were exchanged, and the first 
would be left helpless, lost and bewildered. On this false assumption 
it is easy to build up a formidable theory about art’s concern 
with the basic elements of human nature and to arraign modern 
art for superficiality. But there have always been these two 
kinds, work with the wide, and work with only the special appeal. 
What actually are the differences between them? </p>

<p>The one, the art which keeps the child from play and the old 
man from his chimney-corner, evidently builds up its attitudes 
with the simplest, most aboriginal impulses, and it handles them 
so that the undeveloped mind can weave them into some sort of 
satisfying fabric while the more mature mind, qualifying and 
complicating them until they perhaps lose all likeness to their 
earlier form, still finds them serve its needs. The other is 
built up from impulses which, except in a personality capable 
of very nice adjustments, do not unite in any valuable way, and 
often the impulses themselves are of a kind of which only a highly 
developed mind or one with special experience is capable. This 
last point, however, is separable, and raises a question which 
will be discussed later. </p>

<p>Plainly each of the two methods has its advantages. The poet 
of wide appeal, it is tempting to suppose, has an advantage in 
that the impulses involved are general, have been interested 
all through life and are very representative of experience. And 
he has the further advantage perhaps of avoiding a certain dangerous 
finality. Impulses which adjust themselves at so many levels 
may go on doing so perhaps indefinitely. There may be something 
in the suggestion that Shakespeare wrote better than he knew. 
Certainly it is a serious charge against much of Henry James, 
for example, that when the reader has once successfully read 
it there is nothing further which he can do. He can only repeat 
his reading. There is often a point at which the parts of the 
experience click together, the required attitude is achieved, 
and no further development is possible. Together with this goes 
the sense in the reader that all had to be just as it is and 
not otherwise, whereas with much of Shakespeare we feel that 
anything might have been different and the result the same. “Not 
laboriously but luckily.” </p>

<p>But this is only sometimes true of the sophisticated poet who 
makes no appeal below a certain level. It is not true of Pope, 
for example, or of Walt Whitman, to choose two unlike authors 
who at their best are not generally appreciated. And as a counterbalancing 
advantage for such poets their greater freedom must be noticed. 
Perhaps the chief reason for the decline of drama in the seventeenth 
century (social factors apart) was the exhaustion of the best 
themes which could be used in order to appeal at all levels. 
Drama, to secure audiences large enough to be encouraging, must 
make a wide-spread appeal; but the limitations which this condition 
imposes upon action are very strict. There are no similar restrictions 
for lyric poetry, and it is significant that the greatest lyrics 
have so often a high-level appeal only. The <i>Mad Song</i> of 
Blake, <i>The Phœnix and the Turtle</i>, <i>The Hymn of Pan</i>, 
most great sonnets, are instances in point. </p>

<p>There is, too, no good reason why impulses which only begin to 
make up valuable attitudes in highly organised and discriminating 
minds should lead to attitudes less valuable or more fragile, 
more fixed and final than others. We must not allow the unique 
instance of Shakespeare to weigh too heavily; after all, <i>King 
Lear</i>, the most inexhaustible of his works, is not a thing 
which has great popular appeal. </p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> have distinguished between impulses which are involved at 
all stages of development, their course and fate naturally varying 
with the stage, and those which do not go off at all except in 
developed minds. The responses of the non-mathematical and the 
mathematical mind to a formula illustrate the difference. It 
is the use of responses not available without special experience, 
which more than anything else narrows the range of the artist’s 
communication and creates the gulf between expert and popular 
taste. </p>

<p>In the second chorus of <i>Hellas</i> in the middle of the second 
stanza the rhythm, tune, and handling, though not the metre, 
become suddenly uncharacteristic of Shelley. A fullness of tone, 
a queer, gentle cadence, and a leisurely ease of movement belong 
to the fifth and following lines: </p>

<div class="poetry"><p style="padding-left:30%; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top:1em">A mortal shape to him </p>
<p style="padding-left:30%; font-size: 0.9em">Was like the vapour dim </p>

<p style="padding-left:20%; font-size: 0.9em; margin-bottom: 1em">Nor preyed until their Lord had taken flight. </p></div>

<p class="noindent">And this tone and movement are in clear contrast with the fever, 
the impetuosity, the shrillness and rapidity of the first stanza, 
or of the closing lines of the second: </p>

<div class="poetry"><p style="padding-left:30%; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top:1em">The moon of Mahomet </p>
<p style="padding-left:30%; font-size: 0.9em">Arose, and it shall set: </p>

<p style="padding-left:20%; font-size: 0.9em; margin-bottom: 1em">The Cross leads generations on. </p></div>

<p>The difference is difficult to describe except perhaps: by the 
aid of a musical notation. It is like the difference between 
two voices, and in spite of the highly characteristic matter<a id="note28.1text"></a><a href="#note28.1">*</a> 
of the lines, the reader feels that not Shelley but some other 
poet is speaking. What Shelley is doing becomes unmistakable 
in the third and last stanza. The corresponding lines, again 
in clear contrast with the lines surrounding them, have the same 
strange modulation: </p>

<div class="poetry"><p style="padding-left:30%; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top:1em">So fleet, so faint, so fair, </p>
<p style="padding-left:30%; font-size: 0.9em">The Powers of Earth and Air </p>
<p style="padding-left:20%; font-size: 0.9em">Fled from the folding-star of Bethlehem. </p>

<p style="padding-left:20%; font-size: 0.9em; margin-bottom: 1em">Grew weak, for killing Truth had glared on them. </p></div>

<p class="noindent">In a manner more familiar perhaps in music than in poetry Shelley 
is echoing another poem, borrowing, as it were, Milton’s voice 
though not his words, making in fact a musical quotation, a poetical 
allusion of an exquisite felicity. </p>

<p>But by so doing he is necessarily restricting the number of the 
readers who will fully appreciate him. </p>

<p>Such allusions are a normal and regular part of the resources 
of all poets who belong to the literary tradition, that is to 
say, of the vast majority of poets in modern times. They are 
not often so unobtrusive and the place which they are given in 
the structure of the poem varies. Sometimes, as in this instance, 
a failure on the part of the reader has no important consequences. 
One familiar with the <i>Hymn on the Morning of Christ’s Nativity</i> 
will respond more fully and with a deeper sense of the situation; 
but a reader unfamiliar with it is not deprived of any major 
part of the poem. In other cases the loss is more serious. Another 
instance from Shelley will illustrate this, and it is interesting 
for its own sake. The Shape which guides the Chariot in the <i>Triumph 
of Life</i> is described and identified for the reader in a large 
degree through another Miltonic quotation or allusion: </p>

<p style="text-indent:0em; font-size: 0.9em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-top: 1em; padding-left:10%">A Shape <br>
So sate within, as one whom years deform, <br>
Beneath a dusky hood and double cape, <br>
Crouching within the shadow of a tomb, <br>
And o’er what seemed the head a cloud-like crape <br>
Was bent. </p></div>

<p>Shelley, it is known, crystallised much of his philosophy in 
the sentence: ‘Death is the veil which those who live call life’, 
and the reference<a id="note28.2text"></a><a href="#note28.2">†</a> here to the guardian of Hell Gate, </p>

<div class="poetry"><p style="text-indent:50%; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top:1em">What seem’d his head </p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 0.9em; margin-bottom:1em">The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on, </p></div></div>

<p class="noindent">is not accidental or unimportant for the understanding of the 
poem. </p>

<p>Some care is needed in considering the problem of allusions. 
There may be worthy and unworthy motives behind their employment 
ad their enjoyment. There are some to whom a familiarity with 
literature occasions a sense of superiority over others which 
is trivial and mean. The pleasure of recognition, proportional 
as it is to the difficulty or unobtrusiveness of the allusion 
is a thing of slight value, not to be confused with literary 
or poetic values. It is perfectly possible for a reader, familiar 
with the <i>Nativity Hymn</i>, for example, to receive all that 
Shelley intended without ever noticing the allusion, without, 
that is to say, any recognition. But the erudite often forget 
that this happens. To turn the capacity of recognising recondite 
references into a shibboleth by which culture may be estimated 
is a perversion to which scholarly persons are too much addicted. 
The point is worth mentioning, since this snobbishness, percolating 
down (or, if the metaphor be preferred, by repercussion) is responsible 
for much insincerity and timidity, for wrong attitudes of many 
kinds towards literature, for irritation and oppression developing 
into distaste and neglect of poetry. Allusion is a trap for the 
writer almost as effective as for the academic critic. It invites 
insincerity. It may encourage and disguise laziness. When it 
becomes a habit it is a disease. But these dangers form no ground 
for denying to allusion, and the similar resources of which it 
is typical, a fit and justifiable place in poetry. </p>

<p>Allusion is the most striking of the ways in which poetry takes 
into its service elements and forms of experience which are not 
inevitable to life but need to be specially acquired. And the 
difficulty which it raises is merely a special instance of a 
general communicative difficulty which will probably increase 
for the poetry of the future. All the thought and feeling of 
recent man goes on in terms of experience which is much more 
likely to be special and peculiar to the individual, than, let 
us say, the experience of medieval man. The survival of medieval 
man on such a vast scale among us should not mislead in this 
matter. The people who are most keenly and variously interested, 
that is to say, the people whose lives are most valuable on our 
theory of value, the people for whom the poet writes and by his 
appeal to whom he is judged, inevitably build up their minds 
with far more varied elements than has ever been the case before. 
And the poet, in so far as he is equal to his opportunities, 
does the same. It is hard, and, in fact, impossible, to deny 
him his natural and necessary resources on the ground that a 
majority of his readers will not understand. This is not his 
fault but the fault of the social structure. Given present conditions 
and future developments in the directions indicated by the changes 
of the last two hundred years, it is extremely probable that 
poets will become not less but more allusive, that their work 
will depend more and more not only upon other poetry but upon 
all manner of special fields of familiarity.<a id="note28.3text"></a><a href="#note28.3">*</a> Many of the finest 
and most widely significant experiences, and those therefore 
most suitable for poetry, come nowadays, for example, through 
reading pieces of advanced research. There is nothing new in 
this, of course, nothing that was not happening when Donne wrote. 
The difficulty springs from the fact that research is so much 
further ahead than it used to be. </p>

<span class="smcap">Permanence as a Criterion</span> </h2>

Crooked eclipses ’gainst his glory fight. </p>
<p style="text-align:right; padding-right:2em"><span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>, <i>Sonnet LX.</i></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> permanence of poetry is a subject closely connected with 
the foregoing. Just as there is a prejudice in favour of work 
with a wide popular appeal, so there is another in favour of 
work which lasts, which has “stood the verdict of the centuries”, 
or is thought likely to stand it. Both are in part due to critical 
timidity; if we cannot decide ourselves, let us at least count 
hands and go with the majority. </p>

<p>But circumstances which have nothing to do with value sometimes 
determine survival, and work which is of great value must often 
perish for that very reason. It never gets printed, none will 
look at it or listen to it. And immortality often attaches itself 
to the bad as firmly as to the good. Few things are worse than 
<i>Hiawatha</i> or <i>The Black Cat</i>, <i>Lorna Doone</i> or 
<i>Le Crime de Silvestre Bonnard</i>, and some of the greatest 
favourites<a id="note29.1text"></a><a href="#note29.1">*</a> of the anthologies figure there through their ‘bad 
eminence’. </p>

<p>There are, however, reasons for connecting persistence of appeal 
with a certain type of structure, and, which is more interesting, 
instant fame with a failure to appeal to subsequent generations. 
Work which relies upon ready-made attitudes, without being able 
to reconstitute similar attitudes when they are not already existent, 
will often make an appeal to one generation which is a mystery 
to the generations with different attitudes which follow. But 
this disadvantage from the point of view of permanence of communication 
does not necessarily involve any lack of value for those to whom 
the experiences are accessible. Very often, of course, it will 
accompany low value; but this need not be so. </p>

<p>The permanence of some art has often been an excuse for fantastic 
hypotheses. Such art has been thought to embody immortal essences, 
to reveal special kinds of ‘eternal’ truths. But such debilitating 
speculations here no less than elsewhere should be avoided. Those 
are not the terms in which the matter may best be discussed. 
The uniformity of the impulses from which the work of art starts 
is a sufficient explanation of its permanence. Where the impulses 
involved are only accidentally touched off through being temporarily 
in a heightened state of excitability, we may reasonably expect 
that there will be little permanence. As a catchword will work 
one year like magic, since certain attitudes are for social reasons 
ready poised on a hair-trigger adjustment, and the next year 
be inoperative and incomprehensible, so, on a larger scale and 
in less striking degree, men’s special social circumstances often 
provide opportunities for works of art which at other times are 
quite inadequate stimuli. There are fashions in the most important 
things as in the least, but for the artist to profit by them 
is usually to forgo permanence. The greater the ease of communication 
under such conditions the greater the danger of obsolescence. </p>

<p>Far more of the great art of the past is actually obsolete than 
certain critics pretend, who forget what a special apparatus 
of erudition they themselves bring to their criticism. The <i>Divina 
Commedia</i> is a representative example. It is true that for 
adequately equipped readers who can imaginatively reproduce the 
world outlook of Aquinas, and certain attitudes to woman and 
to chastity, which are even more inaccessible, there is no obsolescence. 
But this is true of the most forgotten poems. Actual obsolescence 
is not in general a sign of low value, but merely of the use 
of special circumstances for communication. That a work reflects, 
summarises and is penetrated by its age and period is not a ground 
for assigning it a low value, and yet this saturation more than 
anything else limits the duration of its appeal. Only so far 
as a work avoids the catchword type in its method, and relies 
upon elements likely to remain stable, formal elements for example, 
can it escape the touch of time. That Dante is neglected is due 
only indirectly to his present-day obscurity; he is still as 
accessible as ever through his formal side. It is the labour 
required from readers who are not content with a partial approach 
which explains why he is so little read even by the scholarly. 
What can be translated in: him, the content, is precisely what 
is of least present and future interest, and at the same time 
most difficult to understand. </p>

<span class="smcap">The Definition of a Poem</span></h2>
<div class ="epigraph">
<p class="hangingindent">Men take the words they find in use among their neighbours, and that 
they may not seem ignorant what they stand for use them confidently 
without much troubling their heads about a certain fixed 
meaning. . . . it being all one to draw these men out of their 
mistakes, who have no settled notions, as to dispossess a Vagrant 
of his habitation, who has no settled abode. This I guess to be 
so; and every one may observe in himself or others whether it 
be so or not.</p> 
<p class="smcap" style="text-align:right; padding-right:2em">Locke. </p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> may be useful to collect here some of the results of the foregoing 
sections and consider them from the point of view of the practising 
critic. The most salient perhaps is the desirability of distinguishing 
clearly between the communicative and the value aspects of a 
work of art. We may praise or condemn a work on either ground 
or upon both, but if it fails entirely as a vehicle of communication 
we are, to say the least, not well placed for denying its value. </p>

<p>But, it may be said, it will then have no value for <i>us</i> 
and its value or disvalue for us is all that we as critics pretend 
or should pretend to judge. To make such a reply, however, is 
to abdicate as a critic. At the least a critic is concerned with 
the value of things for himself and for people like him. Otherwise 
his criticism is mere autobiography. And any critic worth attention 
makes a further claim, a claim to sanity. His judgment is only 
of general interest in so far as it is representative and reflects 
what happens in a mind of a certain kind, developed in a certain 
fashion. The services of bad critics are sometimes not less than 
those of good critics, but that is only because we can divine 
from their responses what other people’s responses are likely 
to be. </p>

<p>We must distinguish between standard or normal criticism and 
erratic or eccentric criticism. As critics Lamb or Coleridge 
are very far from normal; none the less they are of extraordinary 
fertility in suggestion. Their responses are often erratic even 
when of most revelatory character. In such cases we do not take 
them as standards to which we endeavour to approximate, we do 
not attempt to see eye to eye with them. Instead we use them 
as means by which to make quite different approaches ourselves 
to the works which they have characteristically but eccentrically 
interpreted. </p>

<p>The distinction between a personal or idiosyncratic judgment 
and a normative is sometimes overlooked. A critic should often 
be in a position to say, “I don’t like this but I know it is 
good”, or “I like this and condemn it”, or “This is the effect 
which it produces upon me, and this quite different effect is 
the one it should produce.” For obvious reasons he rarely makes 
any such statements. But many people would regard praise of a 
work which is actually disliked by the praiser as immoral. This 
is a confusion of ideas. Any honest reader knows fairly well 
the points at which his sensibility is distorted, at which he 
fails as a normal critic and in what ways. It is his duty to 
take these into consideration in passing judgment upon the value 
of a work. His rank as a critic depends at least as much upon 
his ability to discount these personal peculiarities as upon 
any hypothetical impeccability of his actual responses. </p>

<p>So far we have been considering those cases in which the vehicle 
is sufficiently adequate and the critic sufficiently representative 
and careful for the response to be a good index of the value 
of the poem. But these cases are comparatively rare. The superstition 
which any language not intolerably prolix and uncouth encourages 
that there is something actual, <i>the poem</i>, which all readers 
have access to and upon which they pass judgment, misleads us. 
We naturally talk about poems (and pictures, etc.) in a way which 
makes it impossible for anybody to discover what it is we are 
talking about. Most critical discussion, in other words, is primarily 
emotive with only a very loose and fourfold equivocal reference. 
We may be talking about the artist’s experience, such of it as 
is relevant OF about The experience of a qualified reader who 
made no mistakes, or about an ideal and perfect reader’s possible 
experience, or about our own actual experience. All four in most 
cases will be qualitatively different. Communication is perhaps 
never perfect, so the first and the last will differ. The second 
and third differ also, from the others and from one another, 
the third being what we ought unrestrictedly to experience, or 
the best experience we could possibly undergo, whereas the second 
is merely what we ought to experience as things are, or the best 
experience that we can expect. </p>

<p>Which of these possible definitions of a poem shall we adopt? 
The question is one of convenience merely; but it is by no means 
easy to decide. The most usual practice is to mean by <i>the 
poem</i> either the first or the last; or, by forgetting what 
communication is, to mean both confusedly together. The last 
involves the personal judgment to which exception was taken on 
the previous page, and has the further disadvantage that there 
would be for every sonnet as many poems as readers. A and B, 
discussing <i>Westminster Bridge</i> as they thought, would unwittingly 
be discussing two different things. For some purposes, for the 
disentanglement of some misunderstandings, it is convenient 
to define a poem temporarily in this manner. </p>

<p>To define the poem as the artist’s experience is a better solution. 
But it will not do as it stands since nobody but the artist has 
that experience. We must be more ingenious. We cannot take any 
single experience as the poem; we must have a class of more or 
less similar experiences instead. Let us mean by <i>Westminster 
Bridge</i> not the actual experience which led Wordsworth on 
a certain morning about a century ago to write what he did, but 
the class composed of all actual experiences, occasioned by the 
words, which do not differ within certain limits from that experience. 
Then anyone who has had one of the experiences comprised in the 
class can be said to have read the poem. The permissible ranges 
of variation in the class need (of course) very careful scrutiny. 
To work them out fully and draw up a neat formal definition of 
a poem would be an amusing and useful occupation for any literary 
logician with a knowledge of psychology. The experiences must 
evidently include the reading of the words with fairly close 
correspondence in rhythm and tune. Pitch difference would not 
matter, provided that pitch relations were preserved. Imagery 
might be allowed to vary indefinitely in its sensory aspect but 
would be narrowly restricted otherwise. If the reader will run 
over the diagram of a poetic experience given in Chapter XVI 
and consider in what respects his and his friends’ experiences 
must agree if they are to be able to refer to them indifferently 
as though they were one and the same without confusion or misunderstanding, 
he will see what kind of thing a detailed definition of a poem 
would be. </p>

<p>This, although it may seem odd and complicated, is by far the 
most convenient, in fact it is the only workable way of defining 
a poem; namely, as a class of experiences which do not differ 
in any character more than a certain amount, varying for each 
character, from a standard experience. We may take as this standard 
experience the relevant experience of the poet when contemplating 
the completed composition<a id="note30.1text"></a><a href="#note30.1">*</a>. </p>

<p>Anyone whose experience approximates in this degree to the standard 
experience will be able to judge the poem and his remarks about 
it will be about some experience which is included in the class. 
Thus we have what we want, a sense, namely, in which a critic 
can be said to have not read the poem or to have misread it. 
In this sense unrecognised failures are extremely common. </p>

<br>

<p>The justification for this outbreak of pedantry, as it may appear, 
is that it brings into prominence one of the reasons for the 
backwardness of critical theory. If the definition of a poem 
is a matter of so much difficulty and complexity, the discussion 
of the principles by which poetry should be judged may be expected 
to be confused. Critics have as yet hardly begun to ask themselves 
what they are doing or under what conditions they work. It is 
true that a recognition of the critic’s predicament need not 
be explicit in order to be effective, but few with much experience 
of literary debate will underestimate the extent to which it 
is disregarded or the consequences which ensue from this neglect. 
The discussions in the foregoing chapters are intended as no 
more than examples of the problems which an explicit recognition 
of the situation will admit and of the ways in which they will 
be solved. </p>

and of communication above indicated. The ground, in part at 
least, is cleared. What now can be said as to why the arts are 
important and why good taste and sound criticism are not mere 
luxuries, trivial excrescences grafted upon an independent civilisation? </p>

<p>A number of accounts of varying adequacy each in some degree 
interesting but needing careful interpretation have been put 
forward. The arts communicate experiences, it has been said, 
and make states of mind accessible to the many which otherwise 
would be only possible to few. To this it might be added that 
the arts are also a means by which experiences arise in the mind 
of the artist which would never otherwise come about. Both as 
an occasion for a collectedness and concentration difficult to 
attain in the ordinary course of life, and as the means by which 
human effort may acquire a continuity analogous to but more subtle 
than the continuity of science, the study and practice of the 
arts can give immensely increased power to the artist, preserving 
him from that diffusion of his energies which is perhaps his 
greatest danger. All this is true, but it does not go to the 
root of the matter. </p>

<p>Again the educational aspect of the arts is constantly being 
stressed, sometimes in a manner which does them disservice. ‘Message’ 
hunting—the type of interest which discovers in <i>Macbeth</i> 
the moral that ‘Honesty is the best policy’; in <i>Othello</i> 
a recommendation to ‘Look before you leap’, in <i>Hamlet</i> 
perhaps a proof that ‘Procrastination is the Thief of Time’, 
or in <i>King Lear</i> an indication that ‘Your sins will find 
you out<a id="note31.1text"></a><a href="#note31.1">*</a>’, in Shelley an exhortation to Idealism, in Browning 
comfort for the discouraged and assurances as to a future life; 
but in Donne or Keats no ‘message’—this mode of interpreting 
the phrase ‘a criticism of life’, though to a minute degree on 
the right lines, is probably more damaging than those entirely 
erratic theories, of which ‘Art for Art’s sake’ is an example, 
with which we have been more concerned. </p>

<p>None the less but in subtler ways the educational influence of 
the arts is all-pervasive. We must not overlook bad art in estimating 
it. “I should be said to insist absurdly on the power of my own 
confraternity” wrote a novelist of the 19th century “if I were 
to declare that the bulk of the young people in the upper and 
middle classes receive their moral teaching chiefly from the 
novels that they read. Mothers would no doubt think of their 
own sweet teaching; fathers of the examples which they set; and 
schoolmasters of the excellence of their instructions. Happy 
is the country which has such mothers, fathers and schoolmasters! 
But the novelist creeps in closer than the father, closer than 
the schoolmaster, closer almost than the mother. He is the chosen 
guide, the tutor whom the young pupil chooses for herself. She 
retires with him, suspecting no lesson . . . and there she is 
taught how she shall learn to love; how she shall receive the 
lover when he comes; how far she should advance to meet the joy; 
why she should be reticent and not throw herself at once into 
this new delight.” </p>

<p>The influence is also exerted in more indirect ways. There need 
be, we must remember, no discernible connection or resemblance 
whatever between the experience due to the work of art and the 
later behaviour and experience which is modified through it. 
Without such resemblance the influence may easily be overlooked 
or denied, but not by anyone who has a sufficient conception 
of the ways in which attitudes develop. No one who has repeatedly 
lived through experiences at the level of discrimination and 
co-ordination presupposed by the greater writers, can ever, when 
fully ‘vigilant’, be contented with ordinary crudities though 
a touch of liver may of course suspend these superior responses. 
And conversely, keen and vigilant enjoyment of Miss Dell, Mr 
Burroughs, Mrs Wilcox or Mr Hutchinson, when untouched by doubts 
or the joys of ironic contemplation, is likely to have as a consequence 
not only an acceptance of the mediocre in ordinary life, but 
a blurring and confusion of impulses and a very widespread loss 
of value. </p>

<p>These remarks apply even more evidently to the Cinema. People 
do not much imitate what they see upon the screen or what they 
read of in best-sellers. It would matter little if they did. 
Such effects would show themselves clearly and the evil would 
be of a manageable kind. They tend instead to develop stock attitudes 
and stereotyped ideas, the attitudes and ideas of producers: 
attitudes and ideas which can be ‘put across’ <i>quickly</i> 
through a medium that lends itself to crude rather than to sensitive 
handling. Even a good dramatist’s work will tend to be coarser 
than that of a novelist of equal ability. He has to make his 
effects more quickly and in a more obvious way. The Cinema suffers 
still more than the stage from this disability. It has its compensating 
advantages in the greater demands which it makes of the audience, 
but hitherto very few producers have been able to turn them to 
account. Thus the ideas and attitudes with which the ‘movie fan’ 
becomes familiar tend to be peculiarly clumsy and inapplicable 
to life. Other causes, connected with the mentality of producers, 
increase the effect. </p>

<p>The danger lies not in the fact that school-girls are sometimes 
incited to poke revolvers at taximen, but in much subtler and 
more insinuating influences. Most films indeed are much more 
suited to children than to adults, and it is the adults who really 
suffer from them. No one can intensely and whole-heartedly enjoy 
and enter into experiences whose fabric is as crude as that of 
the average super-film without a disorganisation which has its 
effects in everyday life. The extent to which second-hand experience 
of a crass and inchoate type is replacing ordinary life offers 
a threat which has not yet been realised. If a false theory of 
the severance and disconnection between ‘æsthetic’ and ordinary 
experience has prevented the value of the arts from being understood, 
it has also preserved their dangers from recognition. </p>

<p>Those who have attempted to find a place in the whole structure 
of life for the arts have often made use of the conception of 
Play; and Groos and Herbert Spencer are famous exponents of the 
theory. As with so many other Æsthetic Doctrines the opinion 
that Art is a form of Play may indicate either a very shallow 
or a very penetrating view. All depends upon the conception of 
Play which is entertained. Originally the view arose in connection 
with survival values. Art, it was thought, had little practical 
value of the obvious kinds, so some indirect means must be found 
by which it could be thought to be of service. Perhaps, like 
play, it was a means of harmlessly expending superfluous energy. 
A more useful contribution was made when the problem of the value 
of play itself was seriously attacked. The immense practical 
utility of most forms of play then became evident. Characteristically 
play is the preparatory organisation and development of impulses. 
It may easily become too narrowly specialised, and the impulses 
active may be such as never to receive ‘serious’ exercise. None 
the less with our present understanding of the amazingly recondite 
interactions between what appear to be totally different activities 
of the nervous system, the importance of play is not likely to 
need much insistence.  </p>

<p>There are many human activities which, fortunately or unfortunately 
as the case may be, are no longer required of or possible to 
civilised man. Yet their total discontinuance may lead to grave 
disturbances. For some of these play serves as an opportunity. 
The view that art provides in some cases an analogous outlet 
through vicarious experience has naturally been put forward, 
notably by Mr Havelock Ellis. “We have lost the orgy, but in 
its place we have art<a id="note31.2text"></a><a href="#note31.2">†</a>.” If we do not extend the ‘sublimation’ 
theory too far or try to bring under this Safety-valve heading 
work with which it has no concern, it may be granted that in 
some cases the explanation is in place. But the temptation to 
extend it, and so to misconceive the whole matter, is great. </p>

<p>The objection to the Play Theory, unless very carefully stated, 
lies in its suggestion that the experiences of Art are in some 
way incomplete, that they are substitutes, meagre copies of the 
real thing, well enough for those who cannot obtain better. “The 
moralising force of Art lies, not in its capacity to present 
a timid imitation of our experiences, but in its power to go 
beyond our experience, satisfying and harmonising the unfulfilled 
activities of our nature.”<a id="note31.3text"></a><a href="#note31.3">†</a> The Copy View, with the antithesis 
between Life and Literature which so often accompanies it, is 
a devastating misconception. Coupled with the suggestion involved 
by the word ‘Play,’ that such things are for the young rather 
than for the mature, and that Art is something one grows out 
of, it has a large share of the responsibility for the present 
state of the Arts and of Criticism. Its only rival in obscuring 
the issues is its close cousin the Amusement or Relaxation Theory. </p>

<p>The experiences which the arts offer are not obtainable, or but 
rarely, elsewhere. Would that they were! They are not incomplete; 
they might better be described as ordinary experiences completed. 
They are not such that the most adequately equipped person can 
dispense with them and suffer no loss, and this loss is not momentary, 
but recurrent and permanent; the best equipped are precisely 
the people who most value these experiences. Nor is Art, as by 
way of corollary is sometimes maintained, a thing which had its’ 
function in the youth of the world, but with the development 
of Science becomes obsolete. It may very possibly decline and 
even disappear, but if it does a biological calamity of the first 
order will have occurred. Nor again is it something which may 
be postponed while premillennial man grapples with more immediate 
problems. The raising of the standard of response is as immediate 
a problem as any, and the arts are the chief instrument by which 
it may be raised <i>or lowered</i>. </p>

<p>Hitherto we have been concerned chiefly with more or less specific 
effects of the experiences of the arts, with the effects, upon 
single definite groups or systems of impulses, of their exercise 
in these experiences. The Play Theory tends to limit us to these 
consequences. Important though they are, we must not overlook 
the more general effects which any well-organised experience 
produces. They may in certain cases be extraordinarily widespread. 
Such an apparently irrelevant test as the ability to stand upon 
one foot without unsteadiness has recently been employed, by 
Mr Burt, as an index to mental and especially to emotional organisation. 
All our activities react upon one another to a prodigious extent 
in ways which we can only as yet conjecture. </p>

<p>Finer adjustment, clearer and more delicate accommodation or 
reconciliation of impulses in any one field tends to promote 
it in others. A step in mathematical accomplishment, other things 
being equal, facilitates the acquisition of a new turn in ski-ing. 
Other things are rarely equal it should perhaps be remarked. 
If this is true even of such special narrowly restricted impulses 
as are involved in a scientific technique, it is far more evident 
when the major, the most widespread systems, those active in 
our responses to human beings and to the exigences of existence, 
are engaged. </p>

<p>There is abundant evidence that removal of confusion in one sphere 
of activity tends to be favourable to its removal elsewhere. 
The ease with which a trained mind approaches a new subject is 
the plainest example, but equally a person whose ordinary emotional 
experience is clear, controlled and coherent, is the least likely 
to be thrown into confusion by an unheard-of predicament. Complications 
sometimes obscure this effect: a mathematician approaching psychology 
may attempt to apply methods which are inappropriate, and the 
sanest people may prove stupid in their dealings with individuals 
of other races. The specialist, either intellectual or moral, 
who is helpless outside his own narrow field is a familiar figure 
in inferior comedy. But what would have to be shown before the 
principle is invalidated is that, granted equal specialisation, 
the successful specialist is not better fitted for life in general 
than his unsuccessful <i>confrère</i>. Few people, however, will 
dispute the assertion that transference of ability frequently 
occurs although the mode by which it comes about may be obscure. </p>

<p>When very widespread and very fundamental impulses are implicated, 
where attitudes constantly taken up in ordinary life are aroused, 
this transference effect may be very marked. Everybody knows 
the feeling of freedom, of relief, of increased competence and 
sanity, that follows any reading in which more than usual order 
and coherence has been given to our responses. We seem to feel 
that our command of life, our insight into it and our discrimination 
of its possibilities, is enhanced, even for situations having 
little or nothing to do with the subject of the reading. It may 
be a chapter of <i>Gösta Berling</i> or of <i>The ABC of Atoms</i>, 
the close of the <i>Vanity of Human Wishes</i>, or the opening 
of <i>Harry Richmond</i>; whatever the differences the refreshment 
is the same. And conversely everybody knows the diminution of 
energy, the bafflement, the sense of helplessness, which an ill-written, 
crude, or muddled book, or a badly acted play, will produce, 
unless the critical task of diagnosis is able to restore equanimity 
and composure. </p>

<p>Neither the subject nor the closeness of correspondence between 
the experience and the reader’s own situation has any bearing 
upon these effects. But indeed, to anyone who realises what kind 
of a thing an experience is, and through what means it comes 
about, the old antithesis between subject and treatment ceases 
to be of interest (cf. Chapter XVI). They are not separable or 
distinct things and the division is of no service. In this case 
the effects we are considering depend only upon the kind and 
degree of organisation which is given to the experiences. If 
it is at the level of our own best attempts or above it (but 
not so far above as to be out of reach) we are refreshed. But 
if our own organisation is broken down, forced to a cruder, a 
more wasteful level, we are depressed and temporarily incapacitated, 
not only locally but generally. It is when what we are offered, 
and inveigled into accepting, is only slightly inferior to our 
own developed capacity, so that it is no easy matter to see what 
is wrong, that the effect is greatest. Stuff of an evident and 
extreme badness is exhilarating rather than depressing when taken 
from a discriminating standpoint; and there need be nothing snobbish 
or self-congratulatory in such reading. What is really discomposing 
and damaging to the critical reader is the mediocre, the work 
which falls just below his own standards of response. Hence the 
rage which some feel at the productions of Sir James Barrie, 
Mr Locke, or Sir Hall Caine, a rage which work comparatively 
devoid of merits fails to excite. </p>

<p>These effects are not merely momentary or evanescent; if we would 
understand the place of the arts in civilisation we must consider 
them more closely. An improvement of response is the only benefit 
which anyone can receive, and the degradation, the lowering of 
a response, is the only calamity. When we take into account not 
merely the impulses actually concerned in the experience but 
all the allied groups which thrive or suffer with it, and all 
the far-reaching effects of success or failure upon activities 
which may seem to be independent, the fact that some people feel 
so keenly about the arts is no longer surprising. </p>

<p>Underestimation of the importance of the arts is nearly always 
due to ignorance of the workings of the mind. Experiences such 
as these, into which we willingly and whole-heartedly enter, 
or into which we may be enticed and inveigled, present peculiar 
opportunities for betrayal. They are the most formative of experiences, 
because in them the development and systematisation of our impulses 
goes to the furthest lengths. In ordinary life a thousand considerations 
prohibit for most of us any complete working out of our response; 
the range and complexity of the impulse-systems involved is less; 
the need for action, the comparative uncertainty and vagueness 
of the situation, the intrusion of accidental irrelevancies, 
inconvenient temporal spacing—the action being too slow or too 
fast—all these obscure the issue and prevent the full development 
of the experience. We have to jump to some rough and ready solution. 
But in the ‘imaginative experience’ these obstacles are removed. 
Thus what happens here, what precise stresses, preponderances, 
conflicts, resolutions and interinanimations, what remote relationships 
between different systems of impulses arise, what before unapprehended 
and inexecutable connections are established, is a matter which, 
we see clearly, may modify all the rest of life. As a chemist’s 
balance to a grocer’s scales, so is the mind in the imaginative 
moment to the mind engaged in ordinary intercourse or practical 
affairs. The comparison will bear pressing. The results, for 
good or evil, of the untrammelled response are not lost to us 
in our usual trafficking. </p>

</div></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">At</span> least six distinct senses of the word ‘imagination’ are still 
current in critical discussion. It is convenient to separate 
them before passing on to consider the one which is most important. </p>

<p class="hangingindent">(i) The production of vivid images, usually visual images, 
already sufficiently discussed, is the commonest and the least 
interesting thing which is referred to by imagination. </p>

<p class="hangingindent">(ii) The use of figurative language is frequently all that 
is meant. People who naturally employ metaphor and simile, especially 
when it is of an unusual kind, are said to have imagination. 
This may or may not be accompanied by imagination in the other 
senses. It should not be overlooked that metaphor and simile—the 
two may be considered together—have a great variety of functions 
in speech. A metaphor may be illustrative or diagrammatical, 
providing a concrete instance of a relation which would otherwise 
have to be stated in abstract terms. This is the most common 
scientific or prose use of metaphor. It is rare in emotive language 
and in poetry; Shelley’s “Dome of many-coloured glass” is almost 
the only example which springs to mind. More usually the elucidation 
is a mere pretence; some attitude of the speaker to his subject 
or to his audience is using the metaphor as a means of expression. 
“The freedom of my writings has indeed provoked an implacable 
tribe” said Gibbon, “but as I was safe from the stings, I was 
soon accustomed to the buzzing of the hornets”. But metaphor 
has yet further uses. It is the supreme agent by which disparate 
and hitherto unconnected things are brought together in poetry 
for the sake of the effects upon attitude and impulse which spring 
from their collocation and from the combinations which the mind 
then establishes between them. There are few metaphors whose 
effect, if carefully examined, can be traced to the logical relations 
involved. Metaphor is a semi-surreptitious method by which a 
greater variety of elements can be wrought into the fabric of 
the experience. Not that there is any virtue in variety by itself, 
though the list of critics who seem to have thought so would 
be lengthy; a page of the dictionary can show more variety than 
any page of poetry. But what is needed for the wholeness of an 
experience is not always naturally present, and metaphor supplies 
an excuse by which what is needed may be smuggled in. This is 
an instance of a very strange phenomenon constantly appearing 
in the arts. What is most essential often seems to be done as 
it were inadvertently, to be a by-product, an accidental concomitant. 
Those who look only to the ostensible purposes for the explanation 
of the effects, who make prose analyses of poems, must inevitably 
find them a mystery. But why overt and evident intention should 
so often destroy the effect is certainly a difficult problem. </p>

<p class="hangingindent">(iii) A narrower sense is that in which sympathetic reproducing 
of other people’s states of mind, particularly their emotional 
states, is what is meant. “You haven’t enough imagination,” the 
dramatist says to the critic who thinks that his persons behave 
unnaturally. This kind of imagination is plainly a necessity 
for communication, and is covered by what has already been said 
in Chapter XXIV. It has no necessary connection with senses of 
imagination which imply value. Bad plays to be successful require 
it as much as good. </p>

<p class="hangingindent">(iv) Inventiveness, the bringing together of elements which 
are not ordinarily connected, is another sense. According to 
this Edison is said to have possessed imagination, and any fantastic 
romance will show it <i>in excelsis</i>. Although this comes 
nearer to a sense in which value is implied, it is still too 
general. The lunatic will beat any of us at combining odd ideas: 
Dr Cook outstrips Peary, and Bottomley outshines Sir John Bradbury. </p>

<p class="hangingindent">(v) Next we have that kind of relevant connection of things 
ordinarily thought of as disparate which is exemplified in scientific 
imagination. This is an ordering of experience in definite ways 
and for a definite end or purpose, not necessarily deliberate 
and conscious, but limited to a given field of phenomena. The 
<i>technical</i> triumphs of the arts are instances of this kind 
of imagination. As with all ordering, value considerations are 
very likely to be implied, but the value may be limited or conditional. </p>

<p class="hangingindent">(vi) Finally we come to the sense of imagination with which 
we are here most concerned. The original formulation<a id="note32.1text"></a><a href="#note32.1">*</a> was Coleridge’s 
greatest contribution to critical theory, and except in the way 
of interpretation, it is hard to add anything to what he has 
said, though, as we have already noted in Chapter XXIV, some 
things might be taken away from it with advantage. </p>

<p class="hangingindent" style="padding-bottom:.5em">“That synthetic and magical power, to which we have exclusively 
appropriated the name of imagination . . . reveals itself in 
the balance or reconciliation of opposite or discordant qualities 
. . . the sense of novelty and freshness, with old and familiar 
objects; a more than usual state of emotion, with more than usual 
order; judgement ever awake and steady self-possession with enthusiasm 
and feeling profound or vehement.” “The sense of musical delight 
. . . with the power of reducing multitude into unity of effect, 
and modifying a series of thoughts by some one predominant thought 
or feeling<a id="note32.2text"></a><a href="#note32.2">†</a>” these are gifts of the imagination. It was natural, 
we shall shortly see why, for Coleridge to carry his further 
speculations upon Imagination into the realms of Transcendentalism, 
but setting this aside, there is enough in this description and 
in the many applications and elucidations scattered through the 
<i>Biographia</i> and the <i>Lectures</i> to justify Coleridge’s 
claim to have put his finger more nearly than anyone else upon 
the essential characteristic of poetic as of all valuable experience.</p>

<p>In describing the poet we laid stress upon the availability of 
his experience, upon the width of the field of stimulation which 
he can accept, and the completeness of the response which he 
can make. Compared with him the ordinary man suppresses nine-tenths 
of his impulses, because he is incapable of managing them without 
confusion. He goes about in blinkers because what he would otherwise 
see would upset him. But the poet through his superior power 
of ordering experience is freed from this necessity. Impulses 
which commonly interfere with one another and are conflicting, 
independent, and mutually distractive, in him combine into a 
stable poise. He selects, of course, but the range of suppression 
which is necessary for him is diminished, and for this very reason 
such suppressions as he makes are more rigorously carried out. 
Hence the curious local callousness of the artist which so often 
strikes the observer. </p>

<p>But these impulses active in the artist become mutually modified 
and thereby ordered to an extent which only occurs in the ordinary 
man at rare moments, under the shock of, for example, a great 
bereavement or an undreamt-of happiness; at instants when the 
“film of familiarity and selfish solicitude”, which commonly 
hides nine-tenths of life from him, seems to be lifted and he 
feels strangely alive and aware of the actuality of existence. 
In these moments his myriad inhibitions are weakened; his responses, 
canalised—to use an inappropriate metaphor—by routine and by 
practical but restricted convenience, break loose and make up 
a new order with one another; he feels as though everything were 
beginning anew. But for most men after their early years such 
experiences are infrequent; a time comes when they are incapable 
of them unaided, and they receive them only through the arts. 
For great art has this effect, and owes thereto its supreme place 
in human life. </p>

<p>The poet makes unconsciously a selection which outwits the force 
of habit; the impulses he awakens are freed, through the very 
means by which they are aroused, from the inhibitions that ordinary 
circumstances encourage; the irrelevant and the extraneous is 
excluded; and upon the resulting simplified but widened field 
of impulses he imposes an order which their greater plasticity 
allows them to accept. Almost always too the chief part of his 
work is done through those impulses which we have seen to be 
most uniform and regular, those which are aroused by what are 
called the ‘formal elements’. They are also the most primitive, 
and for that reason commonly among those which are most inhibited, 
most curtailed and subordinated to superimposed purposes. We 
rarely let a colour affect us purely as a colour, we use it as 
a sign by which we recognise some coloured object. Thus our responses 
to colours in themselves become so abbreviated that many people 
come to think that the pigments painters use are in some way 
more colourful than Nature. What happens is that inhibitions 
are released, and at the same time mutual interactions between 
impulses take place which only sunsets seem to evoke in everyday 
experience. We have seen in discussing communication one reason 
for the pre-eminence of ‘formal elements’ in art, the uniformity 
of the responses which they can be depended upon to produce. 
In their primitiveness we find another. The sense that the accidental 
and adventitious aspect of life has receded, that we are beginning 
again, that our contact with actuality is increased, is largely 
due to this restoration of their full natural powers to sensations. </p>

<p>But this restoration is not enough; merely looking at a landscape 
in a mirror, or standing on one’s head will do it. What is much 
more essential is the increased organisation, the heightened 
power of combining all the several effects of formal elements 
into a single response, which the poet bestows. To point out 
that “the sense of musical delight is a gift of the imagination” 
was’ one of Coleridge’s most brilliant feats. It is in such resolution 
of a welter of disconnected impulses into a single ordered response 
that in all the arts imagination is most shown, but for the reason 
that here its operation is most intricate and most inaccessible 
to observation, we shall study it more profitably in its other 
manifestations. </p>

<p>We have suggested, but only by accident, that imagination characteristically 
produces effects similar to those which accompany great and sudden 
crises in experience. This would be misleading. What is true 
is that those imaginative syntheses which most nearly approach 
to these climaxes, Tragedy for example, are the most easy to 
analyse. What clearer instance of the “balance or reconciliation 
of opposite and discordant qualities” can be found than Tragedy. 
Pity, the impulse to approach, and Terror, the impulse to retreat, 
are brought in Tragedy to a reconciliation which they find nowhere 
else, and with them who knows what other allied groups of equally 
discordant impulses. Their union in an ordered single response 
is the <i>catharsis</i> by which Tragedy is recognised, whether 
Aristotle meant anything of this kind or not. This is the explanation 
of that sense of release, of repose in the midst of stress, of 
balance and composure, given by Tragedy, for there is no other 
way in which such impulses, once awakened, can be set at rest 
without suppression. </p>

<p>It is essential to recognise that in the full tragic experience 
there is no suppression. The mind does not shy away from anything, 
it does not protect itself with any illusion, it stands uncomforted, 
unintimidated, alone and self-reliant. The test of its success 
is whether it can face what is before it and respond to it without 
any of the innumerable subterfuges by which it ordinarily dodges 
the full development of experience. Suppressions and sublimations 
alike are devices by which we endeavour to avoid issues which 
might bewilder us. The essence of Tragedy is that it forces us 
to live for a moment without them. When we succeed we find, as 
usual, that there is no difficulty; the difficulty came from 
the suppressions and sublimations. The joy which is so strangely 
the heart of the experience is not an indication that ‘all’s 
right with the world’ or that ‘somewhere, somehow, there is Justice’; 
it is an indication that all is right here and now in the nervous 
system. Because Tragedy is the experience which most invites 
these subterfuges, it is the greatest and the rarest thing in 
literature, for the vast majority of works which pass by that 
name are of a different order. Tragedy is only possible to a 
mind which is for the moment agnostic or Manichean. The least 
touch of any theology which has a compensating Heaven to offer 
the tragic hero is fatal. That is why <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> 
is not a Tragedy in the sense in which <i>King Lear</i> is. </p>

<p>But there is more in Tragedy than unmitigated experience. Besides 
Terror there is Pity, and if there is substituted for either 
something a little different—Horror or Dread, say, for Terror; 
Regret or Shame for Pity; or that kind of Pity which yields the 
adjective ‘Pitiable’ in place of that which yields ‘Piteous’—the 
whole effect is altered. It is the relation between the two sets 
of impulses, Pity and Terror, which gives its specific character 
to Tragedy, and from that relation the peculiar poise of the 
Tragic experience springs. </p>

<p>The metaphor of a balance or poise will bear consideration. For 
Pity and Terror are opposites in a sense in which Pity and Dread 
are not. Dread or Horror are nearer than Terror to Pity, for 
they contain attraction as well as repulsion. As in colour, tones 
just not in harmonic relation are peculiarly unmanageable and 
jarring, so it is with these more easily describable responses. 
The extraordinarily stable experience of Tragedy, which is capable 
of admitting almost any other impulses so long as the relation 
of the main components is exactly right, changes at once if these 
are altered. Even if it keeps its coherence it becomes at once 
a far narrower, more limited, and exclusive thing, a much more 
partial, restricted and specialised response. Tragedy is perhaps 
the most general, all-accepting, all-ordering experience known. 
It can take anything into its organisation, modifying it so that 
it finds a place. It is invulnerable; there is nothing which 
does not present to the tragic attitude <i>when fully developed</i> 
a fitting aspect and only a fitting aspect. Its sole rivals in 
this respect are the attitudes of Falstaff and of the Voltaire 
of <i>Candide</i>. But pseudo-tragedy—the greater part of Greek 
Tragedy as well as almost all Elizabethan Tragedy outside Shakespeare’s 
six masterpieces comes under this head—is one of the most fragile 
and precarious of attitudes. Parody easily overthrows it, the 
ironic addition paralyses it; even a mediocre joke may make it 
look lopsided and extravagant. </p>

<p>This balanced poise, stable through its power of inclusion, not 
through the force of its exclusions, is not peculiar to Tragedy. 
It is a general characteristic of all the most valuable experiences 
of the arts. It can be given by a carpet or a pot or by a gesture 
as unmistakably as by the Parthenon, it may come about through 
an epigram as clearly as through a Sonata. We must resist the 
temptation to analyse its cause into sets of opposed characters 
in the object. As a rule no such analysis can be made. The balance 
is not in the structure of the stimulating object, it is in the 
response. By remembering this we escape the danger of supposing 
that we have found a formula for Beauty. </p>

<p>Although for most people these experiences are infrequent apart 
from the arts, almost any occasion may give rise to them. The 
most important general condition is mental health, a high state 
of ‘vigilance’; the next is the frequent occurrence of such experiences 
in the recent past. None of the effects of art is more transferable 
than this balance or equilibrium. </p>

<p>Despite all differences in the impulses concerned, a certain 
general similarity can be observed in all these cases of supremely 
fine and complete organisation. It is this similarity which has 
led to the legends of the ‘æsthetic state’, the ‘æsthetic emotion’ 
and the single quality Beauty, the same in all its manifestations. 
We had occasion in Chapter II to suggest that the characteristics 
by which æsthetic experience is usually defined—that impersonality, 
disinterestedness and detachment so much stressed and so little 
discussed by æstheticians—are really two sets of quite different 
characters. </p>

<p>One set we have seen (Chapters X and XXIV) to be merely conditions 
of communication having nothing essentially to do with value, 
conditions involved in valueless and valuable communications 
alike. We have suggested above, however, that this kind of detachment 
and severance from ordinary circumstances and accidental personal 
interests may be of special service in these supremely valuable<a id="note32.3text"></a><a href="#note32.3">*</a> 
communications, since it makes the breaking down of inhibitions 
more easy. This same facilitation of response is also, it should 
be added, the explanation of the peculiarly pernicious effect 
of bad but competent art. </p>

<p>We may now turn to consider that other set of characters which 
have been confused with these communicative conditions, and which 
may justifiably be taken as defining a special field for those 
interested in the values of experience. There are two ways in 
which impulses may be organised; by exclusion and by inclusion, 
by synthesis and by elimination. Although every coherent state 
of mind depends upon both, it is permissible to contrast experiences 
which win stability and order through a narrowing of the response 
with those which widen it. A very great deal of poetry and art 
is content with the full, ordered development of comparatively 
special and limited experiences, with a definite emotion, for 
example, Sorrow, Joy, Pride, or a definite attitude, Love, Indignation, 
Admiration, Hope, or with a specific mood, Melancholy, Optimism 
or Longing. And such art has its own value and its place in human 
affairs. No one will quarrel with ‘Break, break, break,’ or with 
the <i>Coronach</i> or with <i>Rose Aylmer</i> or with <i>Love’s 
Philosophy</i>,<a id="note32.4text"></a><a href="#note32.4">*</a> although clearly they are limited and exclusive. 
But they are not the greatest kind of poetry; we do not expect 
from them what we find in the <i>Ode to the Nightingale</i>, 
in <i>Proud Maisie</i>, in <i>Sir Patrick Spens</i>, in <i>The 
Definition of Love</i> or in the <i>Nocturnall upon S. Lucie’s 
Day</i>. </p>

<p>The structures of these two kinds of experiences are different, 
and the difference is not one of subject but of the relations 
<i>inter se</i> of the several impulses active in the experience. 
A poem of the first group is built out of sets of impulses which 
run parallel, which have the same direction. In a poem of the 
second group the most obvious feature is the extraordinarily 
heterogeneity of the distinguishable impulses. But they are more 
than heterogeneous, they are opposed. They are such that in ordinary, 
non-poetic, non-imaginative experience, one or other set would 
be suppressed to give as it might appear freer development to 
the others. </p>

<p>The difference comes out clearly if we consider how comparatively 
unstable poems of the first kind are. They will not bear an ironical 
contemplation. We have only to read <i>The War Song of Dinas 
Vawr</i> in close conjunction with the <i>Coronach</i>, or to 
remember that unfortunate phrase ‘Those lips, O slippery blisses’! 
from <i>Endymion</i>, while reading <i>Love’s Philosophy</i>, 
to notice this. Irony in this sense consists in the bringing 
in of the opposite, the complementary impulses; that is why poetry 
which is exposed to it is not of the highest order, and why irony 
itself is so constantly a characteristic of poetry which is. </p>

<p>These opposed impulses from the resolution of which such experiences 
spring cannot usually be analysed. When, as is most often the 
case, they are aroused through formal means, it is evidently 
impossible to do so. But sometimes, as in the above cited cases, 
they can, and through this accident literary criticism is able 
to go a step further than the criticism of the other arts. </p>

<p>We can only conjecture dimly what difference holds between a 
balance and reconciliation of impulses and a mere rivalry or 
conflict. One difference is that a balance sustains one state 
of mind, but a conflict two alternating states. This, however, 
does not take us very far. The chief misconception which prevents 
progress here is the switchboard view of the mind. What conception 
should be put in its place is still doubtful, but we have already 
(Chapters XIV and XX) discussed the reasons which make a more 
adequate conception imperative. The rest of the difficulty is 
due merely to ignorance; we do not yet know enough about the 
central nervous system. </p>

<p>With this preliminary disavowal of undue certainty we may proceed. 
The equilibrium<a id="note32.5text"></a><a href="#note32.5">*</a> of opposed impulses, which we suspect to be 
the ground-plan of the most valuable æsthetic responses, brings 
into play far more of our personality than is possible in experiences 
of a more defined emotion. We cease to be orientated in one definite 
direction; more facets of the mind are exposed and, what is the 
same thing, more aspects of things are able to affect us. To 
respond, not through one narrow channel of interest, but simultaneously 
and coherently through many, is to be <i>disinterested</i> in 
the only sense of the word which concerns us here. A state of 
mind which is not disinterested is one which sees things only 
from one standpoint or under one aspect. At the same time since 
more of our personality is engaged the independence and individuality 
of other things becomes greater. We seem to see ‘all round’ them, 
to see them as they really are; we see them apart from any one 
particular interest which they may have for us. Of course without 
some interest we should not see them at all, but the less any 
one particular interest is indispensable, the more <i>detached</i> 
our attitude becomes. And to say that we are <i>impersonal</i> 
is merely a curious way of saying that our personality is more 
<i>completely</i> involved. </p>

<p>These characters of æsthetic experiences can thus be shown to 
be very natural consequences of the diversity, of their components. 
But that so many different impulses should enter in is only what 
may be expected in an experience whose ground-plan is a balance 
of opposites. For every impulse which does not complete itself 
in isolation tends to bring in allied systems. The state of irresolution 
shows this clearly. The difference between any such welter of 
vacillating impulses and the states of composure we are considering 
may well be a matter of mediating relations between the supporting 
systems brought in from either side. One thing only perhaps is 
certain; what happens is the exact opposite to a deadlock, for 
compared to the experience of great poetry every other state 
of mind is one of bafflement. </p>

<p>The consciousness which arises in these moments of completed 
being lends itself inevitably to transcendental descriptions. 
“This Exstasie doth unperplex”, we seem to see things as they 
really are, and because we are freed from the bewilderment which 
our own maladjustment brings with it, </p>

<p style="text-indent:0em; padding-left:10%">Oh never rudely will I blame his faith <br>
In the might of stars and angels! ’Tis not merely <br>

<p style="text-align: right; margin-right:15%;">Coleridge, <i>Piccolomini</i>. </p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Knowledge</span>, it is recognised, is good, and since the experiences 
which we have been discussing may readily be supposed to give 
knowledge, there is a strong tradition in criticism which seeks 
to derive their value from the worth of knowledge. But not all 
knowledge is equally valuable: the kind of information which 
we can acquire indefinitely by steady perusal of Whitaker or 
of an Encyclopædia is of negligible value. Therefore a special 
kind of knowledge has been alleged. </p>

<p>The problem which ensues is for many people the most interesting 
part of critical theory. That so many capital-letter words—such 
as Real, Ideal, Essential, Necessary, Ultimate, Absolute, Fundamental, 
Profound, and many others—tend to appear in Truth doctrines is 
evidence of the interest. This heavy artillery is more than anything 
else a mode of emphasis, analogous to italics, underlining and 
solemn tones of utterance. It serves to impress upon the reader 
that he would do well to become serious and attentive, and like 
all such devices it tends to lose its effect unless cunningly 
employed. </p>

<p>We may most conveniently begin by considering a range of representative 
doctrines chosen from the writings of famous critics with a view 
to illustrating chiefly their differences. Some, it is true, 
will hardly repay investigation. It is far too easy to write, 
with Carlyle “All real art is the disimprisonment of the soul 
of fact<a id="note33.1text"></a><a href="#note33.1">†</a>” or “The infinite is made to blend itself with the 
finite; to stand visible, and, as it were, attainable there. 
Of this sort are all true works of art; in this (if we know a 
work of art from the daub of artifice) we discern eternity looking 
through time, the God-like rendered visible<a id="note33.2text"></a><a href="#note33.2">†</a>”. </p>

<p>All the difficulty begins when this has been written, and what 
has been said is of no assistance towards its elucidation. Nor 
is Pater, for all his praise of clarity and accuracy, of much 
better quality. “Truth! there can be no merit, no craft at all, 
without that. And, further, all beauty is in the long run only 
fineness of truth or what we call expression, the finer accommodation 
of speech to that vision within”<a id="note33.3text"></a><a href="#note33.3">†</a>. It would perhaps be difficult, 
outside Croce,<a id="note33.4text"></a><a href="#note33.4">*</a> to find a more unmistakable confusion between 
value and communicative efficacy. But the <i>Essay</i> is a veritable 
museum of critical blunders. </p>

<p>The extracts which follow are arranged approximately in order 
of obscurity. They rise from the most matter of fact to the most 
mystical uses of truth-notions in criticism. All might be taken 
as glosses upon the phrase ‘Truth to Nature’; they serve to show 
what different things may be meant by what is apparently simple 
language. </p>

<p>We may begin with Aristotle. He makes three remarks which bear 
upon the matter. The first is in connection with the antithesis 
between Tragedy and History. </p>

<p style="margin-top:.3em; margin-bottom:.3em">“Poetry is a more philosophical and a more serious thing than 
History: for Poetry is chiefly conversant about general (universal) 
truth, History about particular. In what manner, for example, 
any person of a certain character would speak or act, probably 
or necessarily—this is universal; and this is the object of Poetry. 
But what Alcibiades did, or what happened to him—this is particular 
truth.” (<i>Poetics</i>, IX). </p>

<p>His second remark is made in connection with the requisites of 
Tragic Character:— </p>

<p style="margin-top:.3em; margin-bottom:.3em">“The third requisite (in addition to goodness in a special sense, 
appropriateness, and consistency) of Character is that it have 
<i>verisimilitude</i><a id="note33.5text"></a><a href="#note33.5">*</a>”. (<i>Poetics</i>, XV). </p>

<p>Aristotle’s third observation is in the same chapter:— </p>

<p style="margin-top:.3em; margin-bottom:.3em">“The poet when he imitates passionate or indolent men and such, 
should preserve the type and yet ennoble it<a id="note33.6text"></a><a href="#note33.6">*</a>”. </p>

<p>Wordsworth’s interpretation carries us a definite stage nearer 
to the mystical:— </p>

<p style="margin-top:.3em; margin-bottom:.3em">“Aristotle, I have been told, has said that poetry is the most 
philosophic of all writing. It is so. Its object is truth—not 
individual and local, but general and operative. Not standing 
upon external testimony, but carried alive into the heart by 
passion: truth which is its own testimony; which gives competence 
and confidence to the tribunal to which it appeals, and receives 
them from the same tribunal<a id="note33.7text"></a><a href="#note33.7">†</a>”. </p>

<p>Wordsworth remains still on the hither side of the gap, as does 
Goethe in suggesting that “The beautiful is the manifestation 
of secret laws of nature which, but for this disclosure, had 
been for ever concealed from us<a id="note33.8text"></a><a href="#note33.8">*</a>”. But Coleridge, from whom 
Wordsworth probably heard about Aristotle, takes the step into 
mysticism unhesitatingly:— </p>

<p style="margin-top:.3em; margin-bottom:.3em">“If the artist copies the mere nature, the <i>natura naturata</i>, 
what idle rivalry!—if he proceeds only from a given form which 
is supposed to answer to the notion of beauty—what an emptiness, 
what an unreality, there always is in his productions. Believe 
me, you must master the essence, the <i>natura naturans</i>, 
which presupposes a bond between nature in the higher sense and 
the soul of man<a id="note33.9text"></a><a href="#note33.9">†</a>”. </p>

<p>But Coleridge held many mystical views, not always easy to reconcile 
with one another. In the same Essay he continues:— </p>

<p style="margin-top:.3em; margin-bottom:.3em">“In the objects of nature are presented as in a mirror all the 
possible elements, steps and processes of intellect antecedent 
to consciousness, and therefore to the full development of the 
intelligential act; and man’s mind is the very focus of all the 
rays of intellect which are scattered throughout the images of 
nature. Now so to place these images, totalised and fitted to 
the limits of the human mind, as to elicit from and to superinduce 
upon the forms themselves the moral reflections to which they 
approximate, to make the external internal, the internal external, 
to make nature thought and thought nature—this is the mystery 
of genius in the Fine Arts.” </p>

<p>Even when Coleridge is most ‘the God-intoxicated man’ his remarks 
to a careful reader suggest that if they could be decoded, as 
it were, they would provide at the least a basis for interesting 
speculation. Many adumbrations of this mystical view might be 
quoted. “There is a communication between mystery and mystery, 
between the unknown soul and the unknown reality; at one particular 
point in the texture of life the hidden truth seems to break 
through the veil”, writes Mr Middleton Murry in an Essay<a id="note33.10text"></a><a href="#note33.10">†</a> 
which as an emotive utterance disguised to resemble an argument 
is of interest. How this feeling of insight arises we have seen 
in the foregoing chapter; the sense of immediate revelation of 
which he treats as “the primary stuff out of which literature 
is created” is certainly characteristic of the greater kinds 
of art. And there must be few who have not by one arrangement 
or another contrived from these visionary moments a philosophy 
which, for a time, has seemed to them unshakable because for 
a time emotionally satisfying. But emotional satisfaction gained 
at the cost of intellectual bondage is unstable. When it does 
not induce a partial stupor it breaks down. The freely inquiring 
mind has a fatal way of overthrowing all immediate and mystical 
intuitions which, instead of being duly subordinate, insist on 
giving it orders. </p>

<p>For the inquiring mind is simply the human being’s way of finding 
a place and function for all its experiences and activities, 
a place and function compatible with the rest of its experience. 
When the mystical insight is understood, and its claims fitly 
directed, although it may seem to those who still misunderstand 
it to have lost all the attributes for which they have sought 
to retain it, and to be no longer either mystical or an insight, 
it does not lose but gains in value. But this further adjustment 
is often very difficult to make. </p>

<p>These Revelation Doctrines, when we know what they are really 
about, come nearer, we shall see, to supplying an explanation 
of the value of the arts than any of the other traditional accounts. 
But the process of translation is no easy matter. They are not 
what they seem, these utterances apparently about Truth. In interpreting 
them we shall find ourselves forced to consider language from 
an angle and with a closeness which are not usual, and to do 
so, certain very powerful resistances and deeply ingrained habits 
of the mind have first to be broken down. </p>

<span class="smcap">The Two Uses of Language</span></h2>
<div class="epigraph"><div class="poetry">
<p style="text-indent:0em; padding-left:10%">The intelligible forms of ancient poets <br>
The fair humanities of old religion . . . <br>
They live no longer in the faith of reason: <br>
But still the heart doth need a language, still <br>
Doth the old instinct bring back the old names. </p>
<p style="text-align:right; margin-right: 10%;">Coleridge, <i>Piccolomini</i>.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> are two totally distinct uses of language. But because 
the theory of language is the most neglected of all studies they 
are in fact hardly ever distinguished. Yet both for the theory 
of poetry and for the narrower aim of understanding much which 
is said about poetry a clear comprehension of the differences 
between these uses is indispensable. For this we must look somewhat 
closely at the mental processes which accompany them. </p>

<p>It is unfortunate but not surprising that most of the psychological 
terms which we naturally employ tend to blur the distinction. 
‘Knowledge’, ‘belief’, ‘assertion’, ‘thought’, and ‘understanding’, 
for, example, as ordinarily used, are ambiguous in a fashion 
which disguises and obscures the point which must be brought 
out. They record distinctions which are oblique to the distinctions 
required, they are cross-cuts of analysis made in the wrong place 
and in the wrong direction, useful enough for some purposes no 
doubt, but for this present purpose very confusing. We shall 
do well to put them out of mind for a while if possible. </p>

<p>The chief departure made from current conceptions in the sketch 
of the mind given in Chapter XI lay in the substitution of the 
<i>causes</i>, the <i>characters</i> and the <i>consequences</i> 
of a mental event, for its aspects as <i>thought</i>, <i>feeling</i> 
and <i>will</i>. This treatment was introduced with a view to 
the analysis which now occupies us. Among the causes of most 
mental events, we urged, two sets may be distinguished. On the 
one hand there are the present stimuli reaching the mind through 
the sensory nerves, and, in co-operation with these, the effects 
of past stimuli associated with them. On the other hand is a 
set of quite different factors, the state of the organism, its 
needs, its readiness to respond to this or that kind of stimulus. 
The impulses which arise take their character and their course 
from the interaction of these two sets. We must keep them clearly 
distinguished. </p>

<p>The relative importance of the two sets of factors varies enormously. 
A sufficiently hungry man will eat almost anything which can 
be chewed or swallowed. The nature of the substance, within these 
limits, has very little effect upon his behaviour. A replete 
person, by contrast, will only eat such things as he expects 
will taste pleasant, or regards as possessing definite beneficial 
properties, for example, medicines. His behaviour, in other words, 
depends almost entirely upon the character of his optical or 
olfactory stimulation. </p>

<p>So far as an impulse owes its character to its stimulus (or to 
such effects of past accompanying or connected stimuli as are 
revived) so far is it a <i>reference</i>, to use the term which 
we introduced in Chapter XI, to stand for the property of mental 
events which we substitute for thought or cognition.<a id="note34.1text"></a><a href="#note34.1">*</a> It is 
plain that the independent internal conditions of the organism 
usually intervene to distort reference in some degree. But very 
many of our needs can only be satisfied if the impulses are left 
undistorted. Bitter experience has taught us to leave some of 
them alone, to let them reflect or correspond with external states 
of affairs as much as they can, undisturbed as far as possible 
by internal states of affairs, our needs and desires. </p>

<p>In all our behaviour can be distinguished stimuli we receive, 
and the ways in which we use them. What we receive may be any 
kind of stimulus, but only when the reaction we make to it tallies 
with its nature and varies with it in quasi-independence of the 
uses we make of it does reference occur. </p>

<p>Those to whom visual images are of service in considering complex 
matters may find it convenient at this point to imagine a circle 
or sphere constantly bombarded by minute particles (stimuli). 
Within the sphere may be pictured complex mechanisms continually 
changing for reasons having nothing to do with the external stimuli. 
These mechanisms by opening little gateways select which of the 
stimuli shall be allowed to come in and take effect. So far as 
the subsequent convulsions are due to the nature of the impacts 
and to lingering effects of impacts which have accompanied similar 
impacts in the past, the convulsions are referential. So far 
as they are due to the independent motions of the internal mechanisms 
themselves, reference fails. This diagrammatic image may possibly 
be of convenience to some. By those who distrust such things 
it may with advantage be disregarded. It is not introduced as 
a contribution to neurology, and is in no way a ground for the 
author’s view. </p>

<p>The extent to which reference is interfered with by needs and 
desires is underestimated even by those who, not having yet forgotten 
the events of 1914-1918, are most sceptical as to the independence 
of opinions and desires. Even the most ordinary and familiar 
objects are perceived as it pleases us to perceive them rather 
than as they are, whenever error does not directly deprive us 
of advantages. It is almost impossible for anyone to secure a 
correct impression of his own personal appearance or of the features 
of anyone in whom he is personally interested. Nor is it perhaps 
often desirable that he should. </p>

<p>For the demarcation of the fields where impulse should be as 
completely as possible dependent upon and correspondent with 
external situation, those in which reference should take prior 
place from those in which it may be subordinated to appetencies 
with advantage, is not a simple matter. On many views of the 
good and of what should be, themselves results of subordinating 
reference to emotional satisfactions, there could be no question. 
Truth, it would be said, has claims prior to all other considerations. 
Love not grounded upon knowledge would be described as worthless. 
We ought not to admire what is not beautiful and if our mistress 
be not really beautiful when impartially considered we ought, 
so the doctrine runs, to admire her, if at all, for other reasons. 
The chief points of interest about such views are the confusions 
which make them plausible. Beauty as an internal quality of things 
is usually involved, as well as Good the unanalysable Idea. Both 
are special twists given to some of our impulses by habits deriving 
ultimately from desires. They linger in our minds because to 
think of a thing as Good or Beautiful gives more <i>immediate</i> 
emotional satisfaction than to <i>refer</i> to it as satisfying 
our impulses in one special fashion (cf. Chapter VII) or another 
(cf. Chapter XXXII). </p>

<p>To think about Good or Beauty is not necessarily to refer to 
anything. For the term ‘thinking’ covers mental operations in 
which the impulses are so completely governed by internal factors 
and so out of control of stimulus that no reference occurs. Most 
‘thinking of’ includes reference in some degree, of course, but 
not all, and similarly much reference would not commonly be described 
as thinking. When we drop something which is too hot to hold 
we would not usually be said to have done so through thinking. 
The two terms overlap, and their definitions, if there be a definition 
of ‘thinking’ as commonly used, are of different types. This 
is why ‘Thought’ was on an earlier page described as marking 
an oblique distinction. </p>

<p>To return, the claims of reference are by no means easy to adjust 
with other claims. An immense extension of our powers of referring 
has recently been made. With amazing swiftness Science has opened 
out field after field of possible reference. Science is simply 
the organisation of references with a view solely to the convenience 
and facilitation of reference. It has advanced mainly because 
other claims, typically the claims of our religious desires, 
have been set aside. For it is no accident that Science and Religion 
conflict. They are different principles upon which impulses may 
be organised, and the more closely they are examined the more 
inevitable is the incompatibility seen to be. Any so-called reconciliation 
which is ever effected will involve bestowing the name Religion 
upon something utterly different from any of the systematisations 
of impulses which it now denotes, for the reason that the belief 
elements present would have a different character. </p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to reduce Science to a position 
of subjection to some instinct or emotion or desire, to curiosity 
for example. A special passion for knowledge for its own sake 
has even been invented. But in fact all the passions and all 
the instincts, all human needs and desires may <i>on occasion</i> 
supply the motive force for Science. There is no human activity 
which may not on occasion require undistorted reference. The 
essential point, however, is that Science is autonomous. The 
impulses developed in it are modified only by one another, with 
a view to the greatest possible completeness and systematisation, 
and for the facilitation of further references. So far as other 
considerations distort them they are not yet Science or have 
fallen out of it. </p>

<p>To declare Science autonomous is very different from subordinating 
all our activities to it. It is merely to assert that so far 
as any body of references is undistorted it belongs to Science. 
It is not in the least to assert that no references may be distorted 
if advantage can thereby be gained. And just as there are innumerable 
human activities which require undistorted references if they 
are to be satisfied, so there are innumerable other human activities 
not less important which equally require distorted references 
or, more plainly, <i>fictions</i>. </p>

<p>The use of fictions, the imaginative use of them rather, is not 
a way of hoodwinking ourselves. It is not a process of pretending 
to ourselves that things are not as they are. It is perfectly 
compatible with the fullest and grimmest recognition of the exact 
state of affairs on all occasions. It is no make-believe. But 
so awkwardly have our references and our attitudes become entangled 
that such pathetic spectacles as Mr Yeats trying desperately 
to believe in fairies or Mr Lawrence impugning the validity of 
solar physics, are all too common. To be forced by desire into 
any unwarrantable belief is a calamity. The state which ensues 
is often extraordinarily damaging to the mind. But this common 
misuse of fictions should not blind us to their immense services 
provided we do not take them for what they are not, degrading 
the chief means by which our attitudes to actual life may be 
adjusted into the material of a long-drawn delirium<a id="note34.2text"></a><a href="#note34.2">*</a>. </p>

<p>If we knew enough it might be possible that all necessary attitudes 
could be obtained through scientific references alone. Since 
we do not know very much yet, we can leave this very remote possibility, 
once recognised, alone. </p>

<p>Fictions whether aroused by statements or by analogous things 
in other arts may be used in many ways. They may be used, for 
example, to deceive. But this is not a characteristic use in 
poetry. The distinction which needs to be kept clear does not 
set up fictions in opposition to verifiable truths in the scientific 
sense. A statement may be used for the sake of the <i>reference</i>, 
true or false, which it causes. This is the <i>scientific</i> 
use of language. But it may also be used for the sake of the 
effects in emotion and attitude produced by the reference it 
occasions. This is the <i>emotive</i> use of language. The distinction 
once clearly grasped is simple. We may either use words for the 
sake of the references they promote, or we may use them for the 
sake of the attitudes and emotions which ensue. Many arrangements 
of words evoke attitudes without any reference being required 
<i>en route</i>. They-operate like musical phrases. But usually 
references are involved <i>as conditions</i> for, or <i>stages 
in</i>, the ensuing development of attitudes, yet it is still 
the attitudes not the references which are important. It matters 
not at all in such cases whether the references are true or false. 
Their sole function is to bring about and support the attitudes 
which are the further response. The questioning, verificatory 
way of handling them is irrelevant, and in a competent reader 
it is not allowed to interfere. “Better a plausible impossibility 
than an improbable possibility” said Aristotle very wisely; there 
is less danger of an inappropriate reaction. </p>

<p>The differences between the mental processes involved in the 
two cases are very great, though easily overlooked. Consider 
what failure for each use amounts to. For scientific language 
a difference in the references is itself failure: the end has 
not been attained. But for emotive language the widest differences 
in reference are of no importance if the further effects in attitude 
and emotion are of the required kind. </p>

<p>Further, in the scientific use of language not only must the 
references be correct for success, but the connections and relations 
of references to one another must be of the kind which we call 
logical. They must not get in one another’s way, and must be 
so organised as not to impede further reference. But for emotive 
purposes logical arrangement is not necessary. It may be and 
often is an obstacle. For what matters is that the series of 
attitudes due to the references should have their own proper 
organisation, their own emotional interconnection, and this often 
has no dependence upon the logical relations of such references 
as may be concerned in bringing the attitudes into being. </p>

<p>A few notes of the chief uses of the word ‘Truth’ in Criticism 
may help to prevent misunderstanding:— </p> 

<p>1. The scientific sense that, namely, in which references, and 
derivatively statements symbolising references, are true, need 
not delay us. A reference is true when the things to which it 
refers are actually together in the way in which it refers to 
them. Otherwise it is false. This sense is one very little involved 
by any of the arts. For the avoidance of confusions it would 
be well if the term ‘true’ could be reserved for this use. In 
purely scientific discourse it could and should be, but such 
discourse is uncommon. In point of fact the emotive power which 
attaches to the word is far too great for it to be abandoned 
in general discussion; the temptation to a speaker who needs 
to stir certain emotions and evoke certain attitudes of approval 
and acceptance is overwhelming. No matter how various the senses 
in which it may be used, and even when it is being used in no 
sense whatever, its effects in promoting attitudes will still 
make it indispensable; people will still continue to use the 
word with the same promiscuity as ever. </p>

<p>2. The most usual other sense is that of acceptability. The ‘Truth’ 
of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> is the acceptability of the things 
we are told, their acceptability in the interests of the effects 
of the narrative, not their correspondence with any actual facts 
involving Alexander Selkirk or another. Similarly the falsity 
of happy endings to <i>Lear</i> or to <i>Don Quixote</i>, is 
their failure to be acceptable to those who have fully responded 
to the rest of the work. It is in this sense that ‘Truth’ is 
equivalent to ‘internal necessity’ or rightness. That is ‘true’ 
or ‘internally necessary’ which completes or accords with the 
rest of the experience, which co-operates to arouse our ordered 
response, whether the response of Beauty or another. “What the 
Imagination seizes as Beauty must be Truth”, said Keats, using 
this sense of ‘Truth’, though not without confusion. Sometimes 
it is held that whatever is redundant or otiose, whatever is 
not required, although not obstructive or disruptive, is also 
false. “Surplusage!” said Pater, “the artist will dread that, 
as the runner on his muscles<a id="note34.3text"></a><a href="#note34.3">†</a>” himself perhaps in this instance 
sweating his sentence down too finely. But this is to make excessive 
demands upon the artist. It is to apply the axe of retrenchment 
in the wrong place. Superabundance is a common characteristic 
of great art, much less dangerous than the preciousness that 
too contrived an economy tends to produce. The essential point 
is whether what is unnecessary interferes or not with the rest 
of the response. If it does not, the whole thing is all the better 
probably for the extra solidity which it thereby gains. </p>

<p>This internal acceptability or ‘convincingness’ needs to be contrasted 
with other acceptabilities. Thomas Rymer, for example, refused 
to accept Iago for external reasons: “To entertain the audience 
with something new and surprising against common sense and nature, 
he would pass upon us a close, dissembling rascal, instead of 
an open-hearted, frank, plain-dealing Souldier, a character constantly 
born by them for some thousands of years in the World.” “The 
truth is” he observes “this authors head was full of villainous, 
unnatural images”<a id="note34.4text"></a><a href="#note34.4">†</a>.</p>

<p>He is remembering no doubt Aristotle’s remark that “the artist 
must preserve the type and yet ennoble it”, but interpreting 
it in his own way. For him the type is fixed simply by convention 
and his acceptances take no note of internal necessities but 
are governed merely by accordance with external canons. His is 
an extreme case, but to avoid his error in subtler matters is 
in fact sometimes the hardest part of the critic’s undertaking. 
But whether our conception of the type is derived in some such 
absurd way, or taken, for example, as from a handbook of zoology, 
is of slight consequence. It is the taking of any <i>external</i> 
canon which is critically dangerous. When in the same connection 
Rymer objects that there never was a Moorish General in the service 
of the Venetian Republic, he is applying another external canon, 
that of historic fact. This mistake is less insidious, but Ruskin 
used to be particularly fond of the analogous mistake in connection 
with the ‘truth’ of drawing. </p>

<p>3. Truth may be equivalent to Sincerity. This character of the 
artist’s work we have already touched upon briefly in connection 
with Tolstoy’s theory of communication (Chapter XXIII). It may 
perhaps be most easily defined from the critic’s point of view 
negatively, as the absence of any apparent attempt on the part 
of the artist to work effects upon the reader which do not work 
for himself. Too simple definitions must be avoided. It is well 
known that Burns in writing ‘<i>Ae fond kiss</i>’ was only too 
anxious to escape <i>Nancy’s</i> (Mrs Maclehose’s) attentions, 
and similar instances could be multiplied indefinitely. Absurdly 
naive views upon the matter<a id="note34.5text"></a><a href="#note34.5">†</a> exemplified by the opinion that 
Bottomley must have believed himself to be inspired or he would 
not have moved his audiences, are far too common. At the level 
at which Bottomley harangued any kind of exaltation in the orator, 
whether due to pride or to champagne, would make his stuff effective. 
But at Burns’ level a very different situation arises. Here his 
probity and sincerity <i>as an artist</i> are involved; external 
circumstances are irrelevant, but there is perhaps internal evidence 
in the poem of a flaw in its creating impulse. Compare as a closely 
similar poem in which there is no flaw, Byron’s ‘<i>When we two 
parted</i>’. </p>

<span class="smcap">Poetry and Beliefs</span> </h2>
<div class ="epigraph">
<p class="hangingindent">What I see very well is the wide-spread, infinite harm of putting 
fancy for knowledge (to speak like Socrates), or rather of 
living by choice in a twilight of the mind where fancy and 
knowledge are indiscernible.—<i>Euripides the Rationalist</i>. </p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is evident that the bulk of poetry consists of statements 
which only the very foolish would think of attempting to verify. 
They are not the kind of things which can be verified. If we 
recall what was said in Chapter XVI as to the natural generality 
or vagueness of reference we shall see another reason why references 
as they occur in poetry are rarely susceptible of scientific 
truth or falsity. Only references which are brought into certain 
highly complex and very special combinations, so as to correspond 
to the ways in which things actually hang together, can be either 
true or false, and most references in poetry are not knit together 
in this way. </p>

<p>But even when they are, on examination, frankly false, this is 
no defect. Unless, indeed, the obviousness of the falsity forces 
the reader to reactions which are incongruent or disturbing to 
the poem. And equally, a point more often misunderstood, their 
truth, when they are true, is no merit<a id="note35.1text"></a><a href="#note35.1">*</a>. The people who say 
‘How True!’ at intervals while reading Shakespeare are misusing 
his work, and, comparatively speaking, wasting their time. For 
all that matters in either case is acceptance, that is to say, 
the initiation and development of the further response. </p>

<p>Poetry affords the clearest examples of this subordination of 
reference to attitude. It is the supreme form of <i>emotive</i> 
language. But there can be no doubt that originally all language 
was emotive; its scientific use is a later development, and most 
language is still emotive. Yet the late development has come 
to seem the natural and the normal use, largely because the only 
people who have reflected upon language were at the moment of 
reflection using it scientifically. </p>

<p>The emotions and attitudes resulting from a statement used emotively 
need not be directed towards anything to which the statement 
refers. This is clearly evident in dramatic poetry, but much 
more poetry than is usually supposed is dramatic in structure. 
As a rule a statement in poetry arouses attitudes much more wide 
and general in direction than the references of the statement. 
Neglect of this fact makes most verbal analysis of poetry irrelevant. 
And the same is true of those critical but emotive utterances 
about poetry which gave rise to this discussion. No one, it is 
plain, can read poetry successfully without, consciously or unconsciously, 
observing the distinction between the two uses of words. That 
does not need to be insisted upon. But further no one can understand 
such utterances about poetry as that quoted from Dr Mackail in 
our third chapter, or Dr Bradley’s cry that “Poetry is a spirit”, 
or Shelley’s that “A poem is the very image of life expressed 
in its eternal truth”, or the passages quoted above from Coleridge, 
without distinguishing the making of a statement from the incitement 
or expression of an attitude. But too much inferior poetry has 
been poured out as criticism, too much sack and too little bread; 
confusion between the two activities, on the part of writers 
and readers alike, is what is primarily responsible for the backwardness 
of critical studies. What other stultifications of human endeavour 
it is also responsible for we need not linger here to point out. 
The separation of prose from poetry, if we may so paraphrase 
the distinction, is no mere academic activity. There is hardly 
a problem outside mathematics which is not complicated by its 
neglect, and hardly any emotional response which is not crippled 
by irrelevant intrusions. No revolution in human affairs would 
be greater than that which a wide-spread observance of this distinction 
would bring about. </p>

<p>One perversion in especial needs to be noticed. It is constantly 
present in critical discussion, and is in fact responsible for 
Revelation Doctrines. Many attitudes, which arise without dependence 
upon any reference, merely by the interplay and resolution of 
impulses otherwise awakened, can be momentarily encouraged by 
suitable beliefs held as scientific beliefs are held. So far 
as this encouragement is concerned, the truth or falsity of these 
beliefs does not matter, the immediate effect is the same in 
either case. When the attitude is important, the temptation to 
base it upon some reference which is treated as established scientific 
truths are treated is very great, and the poet thus easily comes 
to invite the destruction of his work; Wordsworth puts forward 
his Pantheism, and other people doctrines of Inspiration, Idealism 
and Revelation. </p>

<p>The effect is twofold; an appearance of security and stability 
is given to the attitude, which thus seems to be justified; and 
at the same time it is no longer so necessary to sustain this 
attitude by the more difficult means peculiar to the arts, or 
to pay full attention to form. The reader can be relied upon 
to do more than his share. That neither effect is desirable is 
easily seen. The attitude for the sake of which the belief is 
introduced is thereby made not more but less stable. Remove the 
belief, once it has affected the attitude; the attitude collapses. 
It may later be restored by more appropriate means, but that 
is another matter. And all such beliefs are very likely to be 
removed; their logical connections with other beliefs scientifically 
entertained are, to say the least, shaky. In the second place 
these attitudes, produced not by the appropriate means but, as 
it were by a short cut, through beliefs, are rarely so healthy, 
so vigorous and full of life as the others. Unlike attitudes 
normally produced they usually require an increased stimulus 
every time that they are reinstated. The belief has to grow more 
and more fervent, more and more convinced, in order to produce 
the same attitude. The believer has to pass from one paroxysm 
of conviction to another, enduring each time a greater strain. </p>

<p>This substitution of an intellectual formula for the poem or 
work of art is of course most easily observed in the case of 
religion, where the temptation is greatest. In place of an experience, 
which is a direct response to a certain selection of the possibilities 
of stimulation, we have a highly indirect response, made, not 
to the actual influences of the world upon us, but to a special 
kind of belief as to some particular state of affairs.<a id="note35.2text"></a><a href="#note35.2">*</a> There 
is a suppressed conditional clause implicit in all poetry. If 
things were such and such then . . . and so the response develops. 
The amplitude and fineness of the response, its sanction and 
authority, in other words, depend upon this freedom from actual 
assertion in all cases in which the belief is questionable on 
any ground whatsoever. For any such assertion involves suppressions, 
of indefinite extent, which may be fatal to the wholeness, the 
integrity of the experience. And the assertion is almost always 
unnecessary; if we look closely we find that the greatest poets, 
as poets, though frequently not as critics, refrain from assertion. 
But it is easy, by what seems only a slight change of approach, 
to make the initial step an act of faith, and to make the whole 
response dependent upon a belief as to a matter of fact. Even 
when the belief is true, the damage done to the whole experience 
may be great, in the case of a person whose reasons for this 
belief are inadequate, for example, and the increased temporary 
vivacity which is the cause of perversion is no sufficient compensation. 
As a convenient example it may be permissible to refer to the 
Poet Laureate’s anthology, <i>The Spirit of Man</i>, and I have 
the less hesitation since the passages there gathered together 
are chosen with such unerring taste and discrimination. But to 
turn them into a statement of a philosophy is very noticeably 
to degrade them and to restrict and diminish their value. The 
use of verse quotations as chapter headings is open to the same 
objection. The experiences which ensue may seem very similar 
to the experiences of free reading; they feel similar; but all 
the signs which can be most trusted, after-effects for example, 
show them to be different. The vast differences in the means 
by which they are brought about is also good ground for supposing 
them to be dissimilar, but this difference is obscured through 
the ambiguities of the term ‘belief’. </p>

<p>There are few terms which are more troublesome in psychology 
than belief, formidable though this charge may seem. The sense 
in which we believe a scientific proposition is not the sense 
in which we believe emotive utterances, whether they are political 
‘We will not sheathe the sword’, or critical ‘The progress of 
poetry is immortal’, or poetic. Both senses of belief are complicated 
and difficult, to define. Yet we commonly appear to assume that 
they are the same or that they differ only in the kind and degree 
of evidence available. Scientific belief we may perhaps define 
as readiness to act as though the reference symbolised by the 
proposition which is believed were true. Readiness to act in 
<i>all</i> circumstances and in <i>all</i> connections into which 
it can enter. This rough definition would, of course, need elaborating 
to be complete, but for our present purposes it may suffice. 
The other element usually included in a definition of belief, 
namely a feeling or emotion of acceptance, the ‘This is sooth, 
accept it!’ feeling, is often absent in scientific belief and 
is not essential. </p>

<p>Emotive belief is very different. Readiness to act as though 
some references were true is often involved, but the connections 
and circumstances in which this readiness remains are narrowly 
restricted. Similarly the extent of the action is ordinarily 
limited. Consider the acceptances involved in the understanding 
of a play, for example. They form a system any element of which 
is believed while the rest are believed and so long as the acceptance 
of the whole growing system leads to successful response. Some, 
however, are of the form ‘Given this then that would follow’, 
general beliefs, that is to say, of the kind which led Aristotle, 
in the passage quoted above, to describe Poetry as a more philosophical 
thing than history because chiefly conversant of universal truth. 
But if we look closely into most instances of such beliefs we 
see that they are entertained only in the special circumstances 
of the poetic experience. They are held as conditions for further 
effects, our attitudes and emotional responses, and not as we 
hold beliefs in laws of nature, which we expect to find verified 
on all occasions. If dramatic necessities were actually scientific 
laws we should know much more psychology than any reasonable 
person pretends that we do. That these beliefs as to “how any 
person of a certain character would speak or act, probably or 
necessarily”, upon which so much drama seems to depend, are not 
scientific, but are held only for the sake of their dramatic 
effect, is shown clearly by the ease with which we abandon them 
if the advantage lies the other way. The medical impossibility 
of Desdemona’s last speech is perhaps as good an example as any. </p>

<p>The bulk of the beliefs involved in the arts are of this kind, 
provisional acceptances, holding only in special circumstances 
(in the state of mind which is the poem or work of art) acceptances 
made for the sake of the ‘imaginative experience’ which they 
make possible. The difference between these emotive beliefs and 
scientific beliefs is not one of degree but of kind. As feelings 
they are very similar, but as attitudes their difference in structure 
has widespread consequences. </p>

<p>There remains to be discussed another set of emotive effects 
which may also be called beliefs. Instead of occurring part way 
in, or at the beginning of a response, they come as a rule at 
the end, and thus are less likely to be confused with scientific 
beliefs. Very often the whole state of mind in which we are left 
by a poem, or by music, or, more rarely perhaps, by other forms 
of art, is of a kind which it is natural to describe as a belief. 
When all provisional acceptances have lapsed, when the single 
references and their connections which may have led up to the 
final response are forgotten, we may still have an attitude and 
an emotion which has to introspection all the characters of a 
belief. This belief, which is a consequence not a cause of the 
experience, is the chief source of the confusion upon which Revelation 
Doctrines depend. </p>

<p>If we ask what in such cases it is which is believed, we are 
likely to receive, and to offer, answers both varied and vague. 
For strong belief-feelings, as is well known and as is shown 
by certain doses of alcohol or hashish, and pre-eminently of 
nitrous oxide, will readily attach themselves to almost any reference, 
distorting it to suit their purpose. Few people without experience 
of the nitrous-oxide revelation have any conception of their 
capacity for believing or of the extent to which belief-feelings 
and attitudes are parasitic. Thus when, through reading <i>Adonais</i>, 
for example, we are left in a strong emotional attitude which 
feels like belief, it is only too easy to think that we are believing 
in immortality or survival, or in something else capable of statement, 
and fatally easy also to attribute the value of the poem to the 
alleged effect, or conversely to regret that it should depend 
upon such a scientifically doubtful conclusion. Scientific beliefs, 
as opposed to these emotive beliefs, are beliefs ‘<i>that</i> 
so and so’. They can be stated with greater or less precision, 
as the case may be, but always in some form. It is for some people 
difficult to admit beliefs which are objectless, which are not 
about anything or in anything; beliefs which cannot be stated. 
Yet most of the beliefs of children and primitive peoples, and 
of the unscientific generally seem to be of this kind. Their 
parasitic nature helps to confuse the issue. What we have to 
distinguish are beliefs which are grounded in fact, i.e., are 
due to reference, and beliefs which are due to other causes, 
and merely attach themselves to such references as will support 
them. </p>

<p>That an objectless belief is a ridiculous or an incomplete thing 
is a prejudice deriving only from confusion. Such beliefs have, 
of course, no place in science, but in themselves they are often 
of the utmost value. Provided always that they do not furnish 
themselves with illicit objects. It is the objectless belief 
which is masquerading as a belief in this or that, which is ridiculous; 
more often than not it is also a serious nuisance. When they 
are kept from tampering with the development of reference such 
emotional attitudes may be, as revelation doctrines in such strange 
forms maintain, among the most important and valuable effects 
which the arts can produce. </p>

<p>It is often held that recent generations suffer more from nervous 
strain than some at least of their predecessors, and many reasons 
for this have been suggested. Certainly the types of nervous 
disease most prevalent seem to have changed. An explanation not 
sufficiently noticed perhaps is the break-down of traditional 
accounts of the universe, and the strain imposed by the vain 
attempt to orient the mind by belief of the scientific kind alone. 
In the pre-scientific era, the devout adherent to the Catholic 
account of the world, for example, found a sufficient basis for 
nearly all his main attitudes in what he took to be scientific 
truth. It would be fairer to say that the difference between 
ascertained fact and acceptable fiction did not obtrude itself 
for him. To-day this is changed, and if he believes such an account, 
he does not do so, if intelligent, without considerable difficulty 
or without a fairly persistent strain. The complete sceptic, 
of course, is a new phenomenon, dissenters in the past having 
commonly disbelieved only because they held a different belief 
of the same kind. These topics have, it is true, been touched 
upon by psycho-analysts, but not with a very clear understanding 
of the situation. The Vienna School would merely have us away 
with antiquated lumber; the Zurich School would hand us a new 
outfit of superstitions. Actually what is needed is a habit of 
mind which allows both reference and the development of attitudes 
their proper independence. This habit of mind is not to be attained 
at once, or for most people with ease. We try desperately to 
support our attitudes with beliefs as to facts, verified or accepted 
as scientifically established, and by so doing we weaken our 
own emotional backbone. For the justification of any attitude 
<i>per se</i> is its success for the needs of the being. It is 
not justified by the soundness of the views which may seem to 
be, and in pathological cases are, its ground and causes. The 
source of our attitudes should be in experience itself; compare 
Whitman’s praise of the cow which does not worry about its soul. 
Opinion as to matters of fact, knowledge, belief, are not necessarily 
involved in any of our attitudes to the world in general, or 
to particular phases of it. If we bring them in, if, by a psychological 
perversion only too easy to fall into, we make them the basis 
of our adjustment, we run extreme risks of later disorganisation 
elsewhere. </p>

<p>Many people find great difficulty in accepting or even in understanding 
this position. They are so accustomed to regarding ‘recognised 
facts’ as the natural basis of attitudes, that they cannot conceive 
how anyone can be otherwise organised. The hard-headed positivist 
and the convinced adherent of a religion from opposite sides 
encounter the same difficulty. The first at the best suffers 
from an insufficient material for the development of his attitudes; 
the second from intellectual bondage and unconscious insincerity. 
The one starves himself; the other is like the little pig in 
the fable who chose to have his house built of cabbages and ate 
it, and so the grim wolf with privy paw devoured him. For clear 
and impartial awareness of the nature of the world in which we 
live and the development of attitudes which will enable us to 
live in it finely are both necessities, and neither can be subordinated 
to the other. They are almost independent, such connections as 
exist in well-organised individuals being adventitious. Those 
who find this a hard saying may be invited to consider the effect 
upon them of those works of art which most unmistakably attune 
them to existence. The central experience of Tragedy and its 
chief value is an attitude indispensable for a fully developed 
life. But in the reading of <i>King Lear</i> what facts verifiable 
by science, or accepted and believed in as we accept and believe 
in ascertained facts, are relevant? None whatever. Still more 
clearly in the experiences of some music, of some architecture 
and of some abstract design, attitudes are evoked and developed 
which are unquestionably independent of all beliefs as to fact, 
and these are exceptional only in being protected by accident 
from the most insidious perversion to which the mind is liable. 
For the intermingling of knowledge and belief is indeed a perversion, 
through which both activities suffer degradation. </p>

<p>These objectless beliefs, which though merely attitudes seem 
to be knowledge, are not difficult to explain. Some system of 
impulses not ordinarily in adjustment within itself or adjusted 
to the world finds something which orders it or gives it fit 
exercise. Then follows the peculiar sense of ease, of restfulness, 
of free, unimpeded activity, and the feeling of acceptance, of 
something more positive than acquiescence. This feeling is the 
reason why such states may be called beliefs. They share this 
feeling with, for example, the state which follows the conclusive 
answering of a question. Most attitude-adjustments which are 
successful possess it in some degree, but those which are very 
regular and familiar, such as sitting down to meat or stretching 
out in bed, naturally tend to lose it. But when the required 
attitude has been long needed, where its coming is unforeseen 
and the manner in which it is brought about complicated and inexplicable, 
where we know no more than that formerly we were unready and 
that now we are ready for life in some particular phase, the 
feeling which results may be intense. Such are the occasions 
upon which the arts seem to lift away the burden of existence, 
and we seem ourselves to be looking into the heart of things. 
To be seeing whatever it is as it really is, to be cleared in 
vision and to be recipients of a revelation. </p>

<p>We have considered already the detail of these states of consciousness 
and their conjectural impulse basis. We can now take this feeling 
of a revealed significance, this attitude of readiness, acceptance 
and understanding, which has led to so many Revelation Doctrines, 
not as actually implying knowledge, but for what it is—the conscious 
accompaniment of our successful adjustment to life. But it is, 
we must admit, no certain sign by itself that our adjustment 
is adequate or admirable. Even the most firm adherents to Revelation 
Doctrines admit that there are bogus revelations, and on our 
account it is equally important to distinguish between ‘feelings 
of significance’ which indicate that all is well and those which 
do not. In a sense all indicate that <i>something</i> is going 
well, otherwise there would be no acceptance, no belief but rejection. 
The real question is ‘What is it?’ Thus after the queer reshuffling 
of inhibitions and releases which follows the taking of a dose 
of alcohol, for example, the sense of revelation is apt to occur 
with unusual authority. Doubtless this feeling of significance 
is a sign that as the organism is for the moment, its affairs 
are for the moment thriving. But when the momentary special condition 
of the system has given place to the more usual, more stable 
and more generally advantageous adjustment, the authority of 
the vision falls away from it; we find that what we were doing 
is by no means so wonderful or so desirable as we thought and 
that our belief was nonsensical. So it is less noticeably with 
many moments in which the world seems to be showing its real 
face to us. </p>

<p>The chief difficulty of all Revelation Doctrines has always been 
to discover what it is which is revealed. If these states of 
mind are knowledge it should be possible to state what it is 
that they know. It is often easy enough to find something which 
we can suppose to be what we know. Belief feelings, we have seen, 
are <i>parasitic</i>, and will attach themselves to all kinds 
of hosts. In literature it is especially easy to find hosts. 
But in music, in the non-representative arts of design, in architecture 
or ceramics, for example, the task of finding something to believe, 
or to believe in, is not so easy. Yet the ‘feeling of significance’ 
is as common<a id="note35.3text"></a><a href="#note35.3">*</a> in these other arts as in literature. Denial 
of this is usually proof only of an interest limited to literature. </p>

<p>This difficulty has usually been met by asserting that the alleged 
knowledge given in the revelation is non-intellectual. It refuses 
to be rationalised, it is said. Well and good; but if so why 
call it knowledge? Either it is capable of corroborating or of 
conflicting with the other things we usually call knowledge, 
such as the laws of thermodynamics, capable of being stated and 
brought into connection with what else we know; or it is not 
knowledge, not capable of being stated. We cannot have it both 
ways, and no sneers at the limitations of logic, the commonest 
of the resources of the confused, amend the dilemma. In fact 
it resembles knowledge only in being an attitude and a feeling 
very similar to some attitudes and feelings which may and often 
do accompany knowledge. But ‘Knowledge’ is an immensely potent 
emotive word engendering reverence towards any state of mind 
to which it is applied. And these ‘feelings of significance’ 
are those among our states of mind which most deserve to be revered. 
That they should be so obstinately described as knowledge even 
by those who most carefully remove from them all the characteristics 
of knowledge is not surprising. </p>

<p>Traditionally what is said to be known thus mystically through 
the arts is Beauty, a remote and divine entity not otherwise 
to be apprehended, one of the Eternal Absolute Values. And this 
is doubtless emotively a way of talking which is effective for 
a while. When its power abates, as the power of such utterances 
will, there are several developments which may easily be used 
to revive it. “Beauty is eternal, and we may say that it is already 
manifest as a heavenly thing—the beauty of Nature is indeed an 
earnest to us of the ultimate goodness which lies behind the 
apparent cruelty and moral confusion of organic life. . . . Yet 
we feel that these three are ultimately one, and human speech 
bears constant witness to the universal conviction that Goodness 
is beautiful, that Beauty is good, that Truth is Beauty. We can 
hardly avoid the use of the word ‘trinity’, and if we are theists 
at all we cannot but say that they are one, because they are 
the manifestation of one God. If we are not theists there is 
no explanation.”<a id="note35.4text"></a><a href="#note35.4">†</a> </p>

<p>Human speech is indeed the witness, and to what else does it 
not witness? It would be strange if in a matter of such moment 
as this the greatest of all emotive words did not come into play. 
“In religion we believe that God is Beauty and Life, that God 
is Truth and Light, that God is Goodness and Love, and that because 
he is all these they are all one, and the Trinity in Unity and 
Unity in Trinity is to be worshipped.”<a id="note35.5text"></a><a href="#note35.5">†</a> No one who can interpret 
emotive language, who can avoid the temptation to illicit belief 
so constantly presented by it need find such utterances ‘meaningless.’ 
But the wrong approach is easy and far too often pressingly invited 
by the speakers, labouring themselves under misconceptions. To 
excite a serious and reverent attitude is one thing. To set forth 
an explanation is another. To confuse the two and mistake the 
incitement of an attitude for a statement of fact is a practice 
which should be discouraged. For intellectual dishonesty is an 
evil which is the more dangerous the more it is hedged about 
with emotional sanctities. And after all there is another explanation, 
which would long ago have been quietly established to the world’s 
great good had men been less ready to sacrifice the integrity 
of their thought and feeling for the sake of a local and limited 
advantage. </p>

<br><br><br>

<p>The last movement of this machine to think with is now completed. 
I am too well acquainted with it, and have spent too many hours 
putting it together to suppose that it can be worked equally 
well by every reader. Half these hours have in fact been spent 
in simplifying its structure, in taking out reservations and 
qualifications, references to other views, controversial matter, 
and supernumerary distinctions. From one point of view, it would 
be a better book with these left in, but I wished to make it 
manageable by those who had not spent a quite disproportionate 
amount of energy in reflection upon abstract matters. And if 
to some readers parts of it appear unnecessary—either <i>irrelevant</i>, 
in the one case; or <i>over-obvious</i> in the other—I have nothing 
to add which would make them change their opinion. The first 
I can only ask to look again, with the hope that a connection 
which has been missed will be noticed. The second, I would remind 
that I write in an age when, in the majority of social circles, 
to be seriously interested in art is to be thought an oddity. </p>

<h2><a href="#appa" id="appa"></a><span class="smcap">APPENDIX A. On Value</span> </h2>


<p class="noindent">A friendly reviewer, Mr. Conrad Aiken, complains that my theory 
of value is not sufficiently relativistic, that it inevitably 
involves the surreptitious re-entrance of the ‘absolute’ value 
which we had been at such pains to exclude. Except for the word 
‘surreptitious’ and the suggestion that the ‘absolute’ value 
we arrive at is the same thing as the ultimate idea discussed 
in Chapter VI., I agree to this. The purpose of the theory is 
just to enable us to compare different experiences in respect 
of their value; and their value, I suggest, is a quantitative 
matter. To put it briefly the best life is that in which as much 
as possible of our possible personality is engaged. And of two 
personalities that one is the better in which there is more which 
can be engaged without confusion. We all know people of unusually 
wide and varied possibilities who pay for their width in disorder, 
and we know others who pay for their order by narrowness. What 
the theory attempts to provide is a system of measurement by 
which we can compare not only different experiences belonging 
to the same personality but different personalities. We do not 
yet know how to make the measurements required. We have to use 
the roughest kinds of estimates and very indirect indications. 
But to know at least what would have to be measured if we were 
to reach precision and how to make the comparison is a step towards 
the goal. The parallel, though I am not fond of it, between the 
new absolutism which Relativity has reached and this quantitative 
way of comparing the experiences and preferences of individuals 
may perhaps be helpful. But whereas the physicist has measurements 
to work from, the psychologist as yet has none. And further, 
it is likely that modes of mental organisation which are at present 
impossible or dangerously unstable may become possible and even 
easy in the future with changes in social structure and material 
conditions. This last consideration might give any critic a nightmare. 
Nothing less than our whole sense of man’s history and destiny 
is involved in our final decision as to value. </p>

<h2><a href="#appb" id="appb"></a><span class="smcap">APPENDIX B. </span><br><br>

THE POETRY OF T. S. ELIOT </h2>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> too readily forget that, unless something is very wrong with 
our civilisation, we should be producing three equal poets at 
least for every poet of high rank in our great-great-grandfathers’ 
day. Something must indeed be wrong; and since Mr. Eliot is one 
of the very few poets that current conditions have not overcome, 
the difficulties which he has faced, and the cognate difficulties 
which his readers encounter, repay study. </p>

<p class="noindent">Mr. Eliot’s poetry has occasioned an unusual amount of irritated 
or enthusiastic bewilderment. The bewilderment has several sources. 
The most formidable is the unobtrusiveness, in some cases the 
absence, of any coherent intellectual thread upon which the items 
of the poem are strung. A reader of ‘Gerontion,’ of ‘Preludes,’ 
or of ‘The Waste Land,’ may, if he will, after repeated readings, 
introduce such a thread. Another reader after much effort may 
fail to contrive one. But in either case energy will have been 
misapplied. For the items are united by the accord, contrast, 
and interaction of their emotional effects, not by an intellectual 
scheme that analysis must work out. The value lies in the unified 
response which this interaction creates in the right reader. 
The only intellectual activity required takes place in the realisation 
of the separate items. We can, of course, make a ‘rationalisation’ 
of the whole experience, as we can of any experience. If we do, 
we are adding something which does not belong to the poem. Such 
a logical scheme is, at best, a scaffolding that vanishes when 
the poem is constructed. But we have so built into our nervous 
systems a demand for intellectual coherence, even in poetry, 
that we find a difficulty in doing without it. </p>

<p>This point may be misunderstood, for the charge most usually 
brought against Mr. Eliot’s poetry is that it is overintellectualised. 
One reason for this is his use of allusion. A reader who in one 
short poem picks up allusions to <i>The Aspern Papers</i>, <i>Othello</i>, 
‘A Toccata of Galuppi’s,’ Marston, <i>The Phœnix and the Turtle</i>, 
<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> (twice), ‘The Extasie,’ <i>Macbeth</i>, 
<i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, and Ruskin, feels that his wits 
are being unusually well exercised. He may easily leap to the 
conclusion that the basis of the poem is in wit also. But this 
would be a mistake. These things come in, not that the reader 
may be ingenious or admire the writer’s erudition (this last 
accusation has tempted several critics to disgrace themselves), 
but for the sake of the emotional aura which they bring and the 
attitudes they incite. Allusion in Mr. Eliot’s hands is a technical 
device for compression. ‘The Waste Land’ is the equivalent in 
content to an epic. Without this device twelve books would have 
been needed. But these allusions and the notes in which some 
of them are elucidated have made many a petulant reader turn 
down his thumb at once. Such a reader has not begun to understand 
what it is all about. </p>

<p>This objection is connected with another, that of obscurity. 
To quote a recent pronouncement upon ‘The Waste Land’ from Mr. 
Middleton Murry: ‘The reader is compelled, in the mere effort 
to understand, to adopt an attitude of intellectual suspicion, 
which makes impossible the communication of feeling. The work 
offends against the most elementary canon of good writing: that 
the immediate effect should be unambiguous.’ Consider first this 
canon. What would happen, if we pressed it, to Shakespeare’s 
greatest sonnets or to <i>Hamlet</i>? The truth is that very 
much of the best poetry is necessarily ambiguous in its immediate 
effect. Even the most careful and responsive reader must reread 
and do hard work before the poem forms itself clearly and unambiguously 
in his mind. An original poem, as much as a new branch of mathematics, 
compels the mind which receives it to grow, and this takes time. 
Anyone who upon reflection asserts the contrary for his own case 
must be either a demigod or dishonest; probably Mr. Murray was 
in haste. His remarks show that he has failed in his attempt 
to read the poem, and they reveal, in part, the reason for his 
failure—namely, his own overintellectual approach. To read it 
successfully he would have to discontinue his present self-mystifications. </p>

<p>The critical question in all cases is whether the poem is worth 
the trouble it entails. For ‘The Waste Land’ this is considerable. 
There is Miss Weston’s <i>From Ritual to Romance</i> to read, 
and its ‘astral’ trimmings to be discarded—they have nothing 
to do with Mr. Eliot’s poem. There is Canto xxvi of the <i>Purgatorio</i> 
to be studied—the relevance of the close of that canto to the 
whole of Mr. Eliot’s work must be insisted upon. It illuminates 
his persistent concern with sex, the problem of our generation, 
as religion was the problem of the last. There is the central 
position of Tiresias in the poem to be puzzled out—the cryptic 
form of the note which Mr. Eliot writes on this point is just 
a little tiresome. It is a way of underlining the fact that the 
poem is concerned with many aspects of the one fact of sex, a 
hint that is perhaps neither indispensable nor entirely successful. </p>

<p>When all this has been done by the reader, when the materials 
with which the words are to clothe themselves have been collected, 
the poem still remains to be read. And it is easy to fail in 
this undertaking. An ‘attitude of intellectual suspicion’ must 
certainly be abandoned. But this is not difficult to those who 
still know how to give their feelings precedence to their thoughts, 
who can accept and unify an experience without trying to catch 
it in an intellectual net or to squeeze out a doctrine. One form 
of this attempt must be mentioned. Some, misled no doubt by its 
origin in a Mystery, have endeavoured to give the poem a symbolical 
reading. But its symbols are not mystical, but emotional. They 
stand, that is, not for ineffable objects, but for normal human 
experience. The poem, in fact, is radically naturalistic; only 
its compression makes it appear otherwise. And in this it probably 
comes nearer to the original Mystery which it perpetuates than 
transcendentalism does. </p>

<p>If it were desired to label in three words the most characteristic 
feature of Mr. Eliot’s technique, this might be done by calling 
his poetry a music of ideas. The ideas are of all kinds, abstract 
and concrete, general and particular, and, like the musician’s 
phrases, they are arranged, not that they may tell us something, 
but that their effects in us may combine into a coherent whole 
of feeling and attitude and produce a peculiar liberation of 
the will. They are there to be responded to, not to be pondered 
or worked out. This is, of course, a method used intermittently 
in very much poetry, and only an accentuation and isolation of 
one of its normal resources. The peculiarity of Mr. Eliot’s later, 
more puzzling, work is his deliberate and almost exclusive employment 
of it. In the earlier poems this logical freedom appears only 
occasionally. In ‘The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,’ for example, 
there is a patch at the beginning and another at the end, but 
the rest of the poem is quite straightforward. In ‘Gerontion,’ 
the first long poem in this manner, the air of monologue, of 
a stream of associations, is a kind of disguise, and the last 
two lines, </p>

<div class="poetry"><p style="text-align: center; text-indent:0em">Tenants of the house, 
Thoughts of a dry brain in a dry season, </p></div>

<p class="noindent">are almost an excuse. The close of ‘A Cooking Egg’ is perhaps 
the passage in which the technique shows itself most clearly. 
The reader who appreciates the emotional relevance of the title 
has the key to the later poems in his hand. I take Pipit to be 
the retired nurse of the hero of the poem, and <i>Views of the 
Oxford Colleges</i> to be the, still treasured, present which 
he sent her when he went up to the University. The middle section 
of the poem I read as a specimen of the rather withered pleasantry 
in which contemporary culture has culminated and beyond which 
it finds much difficulty in passing. The final section gives 
the contrast which is pressed home by the title. Even the most 
mature egg was new laid once. The only other title of equal significance 
that I can recall is Mrs. Wharton’s <i>The Age of Innocence</i>, 
which might well be studied in this connection. ‘The Waste Land’ 
and ‘The Hollow Men’ (the most beautiful of Mr. Eliot’s poems, 
and in the last section a new development) are purely a ‘music 
of ideas,’ and the pretence of a continuous thread of associations 
is dropped. </p>

<p>How this technique lends itself to misunderstandings we have 
seen. But many readers who have failed in the end to escape bewilderment 
have begun by finding on almost every line that Mr. Eliot has 
written—if we except certain youthful poems on American topics—that 
personal stamp which is the hardest thing for the craftsman to 
imitate and perhaps the most certain sign that the experience, 
good or bad, rendered in the poem is authentic. Only those unfortunate 
persons who are incapable of reading poetry can resist Mr. Eliot’s 
rhythms. The poem as a whole may elude us while every fragment, 
as a fragment, comes victoriously home. It is difficult to believe 
that this is Mr. Eliot’s fault rather than his reader’s, because 
a parallel case of a poet who so constantly achieves the hardest 
part of his task and yet fails in the easier is not to be found. 
It is much more likely that we have been trying to put the fragments 
together on a wrong principle. </p>

<p>Another doubt has been expressed. Mr. Eliot repeats himself in 
two ways. The nightingale, Cleopatra’s barge, the rats, and the 
smoky candle-end, recur and recur. Is this a sign of a poverty 
of inspiration? A more plausible explanation is that this repetition 
is in part a consequence of the technique above described, and 
in part something which many writers who are not accused of poverty 
also show. Shelley, with his rivers, towers, and stars, Conrad, 
Hardy, Walt Whitman, and Dostoevski spring to mind. When a writer 
has found a theme or image which fixes a point of relative stability 
in the drift of experience, it is not to be expected that he 
will avoid it. Such themes are a means of orientation. And it 
is quite true that the central process in all Mr. Eliot’s best 
poems is the same; the conjunction of feelings which, though 
superficially opposed,—as squalor, for example, is opposed to 
grandeur,—yet tend as they develop to change places and even 
to unite. If they do not develop far enough the intention of 
the poet is missed. Mr. Eliot is neither sighing after vanished 
glories nor holding contemporary experience up to scorn. </p>

<p>Both bitterness and desolation are superficial aspects of his 
poetry. There are those who think that he merely takes his readers 
into the Waste Land and leaves them there, that in his last poem 
he confesses his impotence to release the healing waters. The 
reply is that some readers find in his poetry not only a clearer, 
fuller realisation of their plight, the plight of a whole generation, 
than they find elsewhere, but also through the very energies 
set free in that realisation a return of the saving passion. </p>

We can diagrammatically represent the delusion as follows. 
What actually occurs is that A, a work of art, causes E an effect 
<i>in us</i>, which has the character b; A <i>causes</i> E[b]. 
We <i>speak</i> as though we perceived that A has the quality 
B (Beauty); we are perceiving A[B]; and if we are not careful 
we think so too. No one of our recent revolutions in thought 
is more important than this progressive rediscovery of what we 
are talking about. It is being inevitably followed by wide changes 
in our attitudes to the world and to fellow-creatures. One current 
in this change is towards tolerance, another towards scepticism, 
a third towards far more secure founding of our motives of action. 
The startling philosophical changes in the general outlook sometimes’ 
predicted for Relativity (or for popular ideas about it when 
once they become widespread) appear likely, if they occur at 
all, to be engulfed by these more unobtrusive but more domestic 
changes </p>

As will be seen, I am not going to identify ‘beauty’ with

Throughout this discussion ‘experience’ will be used in a 
wide sense to stand for any occurrence in the mind. It is equivalent 
to ‘mental state, or process.’ The term has often unfortunate 
suggestions of passiveness and of consciousness, but many of 
the ‘experiences’ here referred to would ordinarily be called 
‘actions’ and have parts which are not conscious and not accessible 
to introspection as important as those which are. </p>

“On this principle, from which I can see no escape, that every

seems to state that <i>a</i> has to <i>greater</i> the relation 
of referent, while the <i>than</i> states similarly that <i>b</i> 
has to <i>greater</i> the relation of relatum. But ‘<i>a</i>

of <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, without including any of the implications

This view plainly has close connections with Utilitarianism. 
In fact if Bentham’s editor is to be trusted in his interpretation 
of his master’s doctrine, it would be what Bentham intended to 
teach. “The term nearest to being synonymous with pleasure is 
<i>volition</i>: what it pleases a man to do is simply what he 
wills to do. . . . What a man wills to do, or what he pleases 
to do, may be far from giving him enjoyment; yet shall we say 
that in doing it, he is not following his own pleasure? .. . 
A native of Japan, when he is offended, stabs himself to prove 
the intensity of his feelings. It is difficult to prove enjoyment 
in this case: yet the man obeyed his impulses.” John Hill Burton, 
<i>Jeremy Bentham’s Works</i>, vol. 1, p. 22. </p>

Both ‘enjoyment’ and ‘satisfaction’ are unsuitable terms 
in this connection. An unfortunate linguistic gap must be recognised. 
The full exercise of an activity is commonly its own ‘satisfaction’, 
and, as we shall see later, what pleasure may accompany it is 
derivative and incidental. <br>

It is true that in mechanics one might draw up a formidable 
list of names and say “Opposed to all these appeared a certain 
Einstein”, but the cases are not parallel. A scientific advance 
is different from a change of fashion, and no new facts nor any 
new hypothesis—no Michelson-Morley experiment, nor any widened 
purview—led up to the separate value theory of art. Although 
historians of æsthetics are sometimes pleased to present their 
facts as though they represented a progress from cruder to more 
refined opinion, from ignorance to wisdom, there is no sound 
basis for the procedure. Aristotle was at least as clearly and 
fully aware of the relevant facts and as adequate in his explanations 
as any later inquirers. Æsthetics in fact has hardly yet reached 
the scientific stage, in which succeeding investigators can start 
where their predecessors left off. </p>

The fashion in which the term ‘feeling’ shifts about in psychology

The description of images belongs to the first steps in psychology, 
and it is often possible to judge the rank and standing of a 
psychologist by the degree of importance which he attaches to 
their peculiarities. On theoretical grounds it seems probable 
that they are luxury products (cf. <i>The Meaning of Meaning</i>,

Two kinds of onomatopœia should be distinguished. In one 
the sound of the words (actual or imaginal) is like some natural 
sound (the buzzing of bees, galloping horses, and so forth). 
In the other it is not like any such sound but such as merely 
to call up free auditory images of the sounds in question. The 
second case is by far the more common. </p>

It is worth remarking that any application of critical principles 
must be indirect. They are not any the less useful because this 
is so. Misunderstanding on this point has often led artists to

The very strange and important phenomena of apparent telepathy, 
and the feats of some ‘psychometrists’ and ‘clairvoyants’, although 
they may call for a great extension of our ideas as to how minds 
influence one another, do not require any such desperate devices 
as transference of, or participation in, <i>identical</i> experiences. 
If they did, the possibility of investigating them by the only 
technique with which anything has ever been successfully investigated 
would be remote. On any ‘identity’ or ‘participation’ theory, 
communication becomes an ineffable and irremovable mystery. There 
may, of course, be any number of strange events occurring about 
which we cannot know, but to discuss such events is unprofitable. </p>

These types if they must be admitted, have not yet been described 
satisfactorily. The defects of such attempts as those of Jung, 
for example, are shown by the fact that individuals change so 
readily and so freely from ‘type’ to ‘type’, being extrovert 
one hour and introvert the next, rationalist and intuitive from 
moment to moment. This is of course denied by the Zurich School 
but not by the majority of observers. To point it out is not 
to overlook much that is valuable in these distinctions. A satisfactory 
classification would doubtless be very complex, and perhaps of 
the form: An individual of Type A is extrovert under these conditions, 
introvert under those, etc. </p>

<i>Biographia Literaria</i>, Ch. XIII. “The primary IMAGINATION 
I hold to be the living Power and prime Agent of all human perception,

creation in the infinite I AM.” The luminous hints dropped by 
Coleridge in the neighbourhood of this sentence would seem to 
have dazzled succeeding speculators. How otherwise explain why 
they have been overlooked. </p>

<p style="page-break-after:always; padding-bottom:.5em"><a id="note24.4"></a><a href="#note24.4text">*</a> 
Coleridge’s distinction between IMAGINATION and Fancy was 
in part the same as this. But he introduced value considerations 
also, Imagination being such combination or fusion of mental 
elements as resulted in certain valuable states of mind, and 
Fancy being a mere trivial playing with these elements. The discussion 
of this distinction will be postponed to Chapter XXXII, where 
the different uses of the term ‘imagination’ are separated. </p>

A weakness of the modern Irish school (even at its best, 
in Mr Yeats) or of the exquisite poetry of Mr De la Mare, may 
be that its sensibility is a development out of the main track. 
It is this which seems to make it minor poetry in a sense in 
which Mr Hardy’s best work or Mr Eliot’s <i>The Waste Land</i> 
is major poetry. </p>

A very interesting contemporary example in connection with 
which the problem arises perhaps more acutely than ever before 
is Mr Eliot’s <i>The Waste Land</i> already mentioned. The impatience 
of so many critics and the fact that they have complained of 
the presence and necessity of notes well illustrates the confusion 
which prevails upon this question. A more reasonable complaint 
would have been that Mr Eliot did not provide a larger apparatus 
of elucidation. (See Appendix). </p>

Difficulties even here arise, e.g. the poet may be dissatisfied 
without reason. Coleridge thought <i>Kubla Khan</i> merely ‘a

been justified in some degree. If he was not, it is his dream 
experience which we should presumably have to take as our standard. </p>

A discussion of Croce’s doctrines might seem advisable at 
some point. But all that is strictly necessary has already been 
said in <i>The Foundations of Æsthetics</i>. It may be repeated 
here in the vigorous terms of Giovanni Papini (<i>Four and Twenty 
Minds</i>): “If you disregard critical trivialities and didactic 
accessories, the entire æsthetic system of Croce amounts merely 
to a hunt for pseudonyms of the word ‘art’, and may indeed be 
stated briefly and accurately in this formula: art = intuition 
= expression = feeling = imagination = fancy = lyricism = beauty. 
And you must be careful not to take these words with the shadings 
and distinctions which they have in ordinary or scientific language. 
Not a bit of it. Every word is merely a different series of syllables 
signifying absolutely and completely the same thing.” When you 
are not careful the amalgam of confusions and contradictions 
which ensues is very remarkable. It is interesting to notice 
that Croce’s appeal has been exclusively to those unfamiliar 
with the subject, to the man of letters and the dilettante. He 
has been ignored by serious students of the mind. How many of 
those for example who have been impressed by his dicta as to 
expression and language have been aware of how the problem has 
been discussed before, or have ever heard of the ‘imageless thought’ 
controversy? Upon the ways in which Croce’s strategy has inveigled 
the guileless into supposing him to be saying something, Papini 
is excellent. ‘The Barabbas of art, the Thug of philosophy, the 
Apache of culture’—Papini so describes himself—has here rendered 
a notable service to those who have been depressed by the vogue 
of ‘Expressionism’. </p>

<i>ὅμοιον</i>. This word is variously translated ‘resemblance’

No merit, that is, <i>in this connection</i>. There may be 
some exceptions to this, cases in which the explicit recognition 
of the truth of a statement as opposed to the simple acceptance 
of it, is <i>necessary</i> to the full development of the further 
response. But I believe that such cases will on careful examination 
be found to be very rare with competent readers. Individual differences, 
corresponding to the different degrees to which individuals have 
their belief feelings, their references, and their attitudes 
entangled, are to be expected. There are, of course, an immense 
number of scientific beliefs present among the conditions of 
every attitude. But since acceptances would do equally well in 
their place they are not <i>necessary</i> to it. </p>

In view of a possible misunderstanding at this point, compare 
Chapter X, especially the final paragraph. If a belief in Retributive 
Justice, for example, is fatal to <i>Prometheus Unbound</i>, 
so in another way is the belief that the Millennium is at hand. 
To steer an unperplexed path between these opposite dangers is 
extremely difficult. The distinctions required are perhaps better 
left to the reader’s reflection than laboured further in the 
faulty terminology which alone at present is available. </p>

Cf. Gurney, <i>The Power of Sound</i>, p. 126. “A splendid 
melodic phrase seems continually not like an object of sense, 
but like an affirmation; not so much prompting admiring ejaculation 
as compelling passionate assent.” His explanation, through association 
with speech, seems to me inadequate. He adds that the use of 
terms such as “<i>expressiveness</i> and <i>significance</i>, 
as opposed to meaninglessness and triviality, may be allowed, 
without the implication of any reference to transcendental views 
which one may fail to understand, or theories of interpretation 
which one may entirely repudiate.” </p>
